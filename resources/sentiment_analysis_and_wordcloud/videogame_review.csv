1,"1st shipment received a book instead of the game.2nd shipment got a FAKE one. Game arrived with a wrong key inside on sealed box. I got in contact with codemasters and send them pictures of the DVD and the content. They said nothing they can do its a fake DVD.Returned it good bye.!",1
2,"I still haven't figured this one out. Did everything as instructed but the game never installed. Strange. Since I don't like to rate on something I couldn't get to work, I'll just say that I didn't like it because I couldn't get it to work :P For those that did manage to get it installed, I'm sure it's a great game. I had the first Dirt and it was a scream! Too bad this one bombed. Maybe a bad disc...",2
3,"I bought this and the key didn't work.  It was a gift, and the recipient wasn't able to solve the problem.  It might have been a good game, but I never found out because the key failed.",1
4,"I love it! Use it all the time. Really works perfectly with all games that you need a mic for.",5
5,"my grandkids (and their parents) love playing with the microphone along with the guitar we got.this really is a lot of fun for everyone.  would totally recommend getting this if someone has an interest in music (singing)...",5
6,"The greatest bait and switch betrayal of a fanbase in videogaming history and most hated game of all time.To begin I will provide Amazon's customer base the &#34;tale of the turd&#34; as I call it in relation to this abomination's &#34;quality&#34; or rather lackthereof:Gameplay: Utterly challengeless. A lobotomy patient, a two year old drooling baby in a feces filled diaper or even an individual with a severe case of down syndrome could easily complete this game in a single sitting with minimal effort. Just mash buttons or &#34;spam&#34; the controls as PC gamers would say and you'll eventually complete this atrocious slap in the face Disney level Aonuma dreck.Graphics: Hideous, vomit inducing, ridiculous, teletubbies-esque, bait and switch from what we were originally promised at Spaceworld 2000 (realistic style epic, cool and beautiful graphics with a decidedly Lord Of The Rings style flare) Also there are ugly and gaudy white lines that appear all throughout Wand Wacker indicating Nintendo was not able to polish this turd before release. Oh what a shame.Sound: The only redeemable inspiring thing about this Aonuma dud is the ocean music likely composed by Koji Kondo. The rest is detestable Saturday morning cartoon level kiddy drivel. Soccer moms and grandparents should approve. Real Zelda fans can only vomit at this level of disrespect Nintendo has stooped to in order to insult us.Theme: Near total rip off of Kevin Costner's Water World to such a great extent I fully believe Costner could probably win a lawsuit against Nintendo for royalties if he so desired. Needless to say this watery environment is not what true Zelda fans look forward to when we go to pick up a new Zelda game. No, what we're looking for is the green forests and fields of Hyrule proper, not some watery grave that sits atop it for reasons likely relating to Aonuma's child learning how to bathe for the first time and Aonuma getting inspired to make Zelda into a giant bathing simulator via Wand Wacker. I've said it before and I'll say it again Nintendo needs to fire Eiji Aonuma and his entire Zelda team and get normal people developing the Zelda series again for it to return to health.Commentary: The online game journalists also known as professional liars can attempt to re-write history all they like but The Legend Of Celda: Wand Wacker will go down as the most hated videogame of all time and the greatest betrayal of a fanbase in gaming history.This was Nintendo, Miyamoto and Eiji Aonuma's Vince Mcmahon esque &#34;Screw you!&#34; to the true Zelda fanbase and by true Zelda fanbase I'm not referring to the scumbag sycophants that populate online gaming message forums but the market in general who determines whether videogames become massive successes or massive failures and the true Zelda fans spoke loud and clear not once but twice.Two whole times on that Wand Wacker piece of dog excrement first with its original Gamecube release and second with its Wii U HD re-release that this is not the way that they envisioned the Legend Of Zelda series, this is not the way they wanted it to go and as a result Wand Wacker flopped mightily BOTH times as such a Benedict Arnold or Rosenbergs esque betrayal is destined to do.To rephrase a quote from Ridley Scott's Gladiator: &#34;Marcus Aurelius had a dream that was Zelda and this is not it, THIS IS NOT IT!&#34;We were lied to and led to believe that the epic, cool, badass, Spaceworld 2000 realistically presented Zelda would be what we would soon be getting on the Gamecube but then much later the bait and switch hideously deformed Celda Wand Wacker made its debut to boos and hisses worldwide and massive hate on the internet was poured it and Nintendo's way (before the damage control brainwashing took effect which has left a dishonest internet forum gaming community in its wake who pretends to love Wand Wacker in order to shill and run damage control for Nintendo while real Zelda fans have abandoned Nintendo due to its betrayal of them for the other consoles or PC gaming if they haven't simply upped and left gaming in disgusting over this nasty unnecessary debacle and betrayal of Zelda's true fans.Eiji Aonuma the hack no talent Jimmy Fallon Of Japan enabled by the out of touch Shigeru Miyamoto has been ruining the Zelda series since he took up its reigns to create the embarrassment known as Majora's Mask.Aonuma's first game &#34;Marvelous&#34; failed (MARVELOUSLY!) and he had no credentials at all to be given the Zelda series but insanely Nintendo gave it to him and ever since he's been driving Zelda along with it's sales figures into the ground making one boring puzzle filled bad NPC filled faux Zelda game after another.When the truth of the matter is Zelda is supposed to be an arcade action adventure sword and sorcery game with light RPG elements thrown in for good measure.Aonuma completely butchers this formula in favor of the boring garbage gameplay elements he prefers and the market lets him know what it thinks of his efforts by making sure his version of Zelda ends up in the bomba discount gaming bins where such low quality trash belongs.In anycase to re-iterate so as to set this very important point in stone once more:Wand Wacker offers up literally no gameplay challenge whatsoever and can be completed by a lobotomy patient (as is typical of Aonuma offerings).Conclusion: My rating of this turd is 1 star since I can't give it lower due to how Amazon's system is set up.",1
7,"I've bought these before.  They slip right on and unless you get one with an obvious defect, they should last for years.  These are a must have if you are afraid of your kids messing up your controllers.  Then again, maybe they should get their own! lol",5
8,"It works perfectly! Nothing is wrong with it.",5
9,"just right! works great , I' ll be ordering again laters! hope you will still be there then! see you!",5
10,"Works perfectly for the game cube I purchased. Came very quickly and i would buy this again when i need to.",5
11,"I bought this because I recently bought a gamecube for old times sake. This memory card works great, and was one of the cheaper cards.",5
12,"I bought these to extend the length of the game cube controller reach. Everyone that uses these has no issues with poor controller reaction times and can sit just about anywhere to play.",5
13,"Works exactly as advertised. Bought these along with a 2-pack of controllers for the GameCube, as my TV is a ways away from my couch and i wanted to play multi-player with my wife. The controller plugs into the extension cable about as snugly as the controller (and the other end of the extension cable) plugs into the GameCube, which is to say plenty snug enough to keep it in while moving the controller and cable around semi-violently, but not snug enough to keep a controller attached after being thrown across the room (just an example). One major concern I did have when I bough these was the possibility of lag due to the signal from the controller having to travel farther. This concern was unwarranted, as I have noticed no difference in response time either way. On durability, I've had these for almost 2 years and they haven't shown any noticeable signs of wear. Throw in a reasonable price ($4 when I bought it from Amermedia in 2012) and this is a heck of a deal for people that need a product like this. I would recommend.",5
14,"They work fine but i feel like they have a little lag to the controls when i use it on my controller. And out of the two, one is already ripping. They get the job done but i dont think they will last very long.",3
15,"This Cable extender worked great! I used it when and had absolutely no problems with it at all! It adds a good 6ft of extra cable length. I tried hooking two together and I found no extra input lag using these cables.Great if you need the extra cable!",5
16,"One of them broke immediately, the other one still works, I guess they're just too cheap and there's no telling if it will actually work longer than two days.",3
17,"haven't play for long time and love this game as enjoy play. it good play game I guess well alright",5
18,"Love the game thanks!This game is great from the look and the level of detail and the combat. Thanks",5
19,"Looking anywhere else people will charge more than $80 for an old wonderful game like this. Classic games like these are hard to come by, wish I had traded in LESS of my games when I was young.",5
20,"Megaman legends is capcoms answer to bringing Megaman into the 3d realm on the original playstation. However this game is extremly diffrent then any other megaman game out there. In fact it has a lot in common with zelda: ocarina of time and a few rpg elements such as final fantasy while still somewhat feeling like a Megaman game. Coming from the NES and SNES Megamans I never thought I would ever compare zelda and megaman together but surprisingly it works well. Its not the greatest  game or even the greatest megaman game ever but it is really fun in its own way.Most people do not like the graphics in this game but i think there done really well. The only problem graghicly is due to the early psx hardware most 3d games looked blocky and pixely at the time and this on tries to smooth things out kinda cel shadish but not quite this leads to some blockeness but its still better then most 1998 and before graphics. Kinda a 3d playable anime style to it. The sound isn't to bad in this game. Voice acting can be really good or painfully bad andThe music is catchy maybe not as much as the nes megamans but still good. However there is moments without any music. Technically speaking I would say the game has aged well.The thing I find most memorable about this game is the gameplay. Like I mentioned earlier this game takes megaman into zelda like enviorments with a few rpgs elements. There is a open world which was decent in size for its time, which the game takes place in a small town. There are dungeons to explore which you do so in order to find upgrades to your equipment. Speaking of which you can purchase and find diffrent armor and weopens with diffrent specs (attack, fire rate, etc) in a rpg like menu. With that being said it still manages to feel like a megaman game. There is plenty of missions of which you are running and gunning while jumping on platforms. The bosses while set up like zelda can be taken down easier by weopens you find around in dungeons.As for the story it isn't to bad. It is a little childish but its still pretty good. The characters while the voice acting can be off at times can be good are very memorable. Tron Bonne makes her debut here as a villian who became popular enough to get her own game misadventures of tron bonne and a apperance in marvel vs. capcom 2 and appearing without megaman in the 3rd. There is also a N64 port of this game which isnt as good but if you dont have a psx its still playable plus a sequel. Anyway while the hardcore 8bit megaman players may be turned off by this i would still recomend getting this game",5
21,"Well as far as the person who sold this to me goes, the game came as described and in a well timed manner and I would shop here again.  However, the game itself is just not as fun as I remembered.",3
22,"Game works great, amazing story that brings back childhood memories, i love it!!! Awesome game to have that is old school.",5
23,"I remember Tekken 2 being one of my first fighting games I have ever played, and one that I kept coming back to. It wasn't just the nostalgia that kept me coming back, but the overall gameplay as well. Almost everything about this game was done right, and there is very little to complain about.Tekken 2 takes place 2 years after the events of the first Tekken. The plot isn't very well developed and isn't really involving, but everything else more than makes up for it. The graphics (for the time) were amazing and the animations were also nicely done. The roster includes 24 characters who are all unique and feel very well balanced. The game is very accessible and almost anyone can pick up this game and get a pretty decent grasp on it. The controls are simple and intuitive, and I always believed that this control scheme (each button controls a limb-ex. left punch, right punch) is one of the best for fighting games.For modes, you have your basic arcade mode which you complete to unlock new characters. You also have a vs. mode, a team battle mode (which is very enjoyable), a survival mode, a time attack mode, and a practice mode. All of these modes offer allot of replayability as it is easy to dump countless hours into any of these modes.The combat system is still excellent to this day. The amount of combos that each character can do is pretty substantial and you will discover new moves without being too overwhelmed. There also aren't really any cheap tactics unlike some of the more recent iterations of tekken (such as excessive juggling).Overall, this game is one of the best fighting games that I have ever played. With plenty of characters to learn, plenty of modes to choose from, amazing looking backgrounds, and a terriffic combat system, there is no reason to skip this game. If you still have a ps1/ps2, BUY THIS GAME. I recommend this game wholeheartedly, and you won't regret it at all.",5
24,"what is there to say. this game has everything you want in a fighting game! plenty of characters to choose from and the gameplay is top notch for a ps1 game. definitely one of my favorites!",5
25,"First and best, good to play with friends but this game can be a bit aimless at times.  Haven't touched it in years though.",3
26,"They took what was great about the first and somehow made it twice as good. These games are still great for people looking for a challenge, but I would advise first-time players to play the series in order, as each game builds up from the hardest point of the previous one by making difficult-to-learn skills from the previous one rudimentary things you NEED to know in order to play the next, as well as adding a bunch of new tricks and surprises. But, even though there isn't as much actual &#34;Tomb Raiding&#34; in this one, it is definitely a step up from the previous version. Also includes an awesome bonus level at the end where Lara's house is raided by a Mafia strike team. Although, does not include the other bonus levels from the extended version of the game. (The extended version has two more levels, but it's only for the PC)",5
27,"A game that set the standard for the series IMO, clearly the newest one out there set the bar for the entire franchise though.",5
28,"Despite awkward controls that seem to be designed more for a computer than a Game System (and get used to it, because that lasts until the PS2 era-- aka, the sixth game in the series) this has to be one of the funnest games of all time. It gives a challenge on multiple levels & inspires you to keep playing to find out what happens next as things get progressively more dangerous and more bizarre. Was re-made as Tomb Raider: Anniversary, but I'd prefer the original any day.",5
29,"Brought this game for myself, it brought back memories when I was 6 playing this all summer long. Game came as described and fast also.",4
30,"The original Tomb Raider was a landmark game for the Playstation and the start of a very long running series. It holds up well, but is a definite acquired taste.Tomb Raider begins with adventurer and treasure huntress Lara Croft being hired by business woman Jacqueline Natla to search an ancient cavern in Peru for a piece of the Scion, an ancient talisman of great power. However, after finding the piece, Lara is betrayed by Jacqueline's men. Now it's a race across the world to find the remaining pieces of the Scion before Jacqueline attains its mythical power. Tomb Raider is an early Playstation game, and unfortunately the graphics haven't aged very well. Although many set pieces in the game are very impressive all the levels tend to feel very samey. Despite this the game's length is impressive. There are over fifteen massive levels with hidden caches of ammo and first aid packs, giving you a great sense of exploration throughout the game. Lara moves in a very stiff fashion. Her controls are tank-like and You have to hold down a button for her to walk. She takes very long jumps, but running jumps have a delay that requires you to plan your jumps ahead of time in most cases. Fortunately there is a training mission where Lara instructs you on how to play in her home. The game is primarily a puzzle platformer. Each level contains a series of puzzles that will test your problem solving skills.Scattered throughout the many ruins and caves are vicious animals and hired goons all chomping at the bit to impede your progress. This is where combat comes into play. Lara starts off the game with twin pistols that have unlimited ammo. Through out the game you will find a variety of firearms, however these weapons do have limited ammo, but the pistols ensure you will always have a fighting chance in battle.The last gameplay feature to talk about is the process of saving your game. The PC version of the game allowed the player to quicksave wherever they wanted. The console versions of the game on Playstation and Sega Saturn do not have this luxury. You can only save with the use of crystals that are placed along the path you are intended to follow. Unfortunately, once a crystal is used it is gone. This makes it really difficult when you've got a very long stretch ahead of you and not much health. Some areas have multiple crystals forcing you to carefully plan how often you save.This game has many flaws, but it is a very rewarding experience. I would recommend the game for those expecting a challenge. The later games in the Tomb Raider series ironed out many of the issues experienced here. If you're curious about the beginning of the franchise you won't be disappointed, but maybe a little stressed.For classic PC gamers I'd recommend Tomb Raider: Unfinished Business. This is the original game plus two bonus missions with two new levels a piece.",4
31,"The first installment in the series, turned many heads and imaginations of many.  A good flick if you're bored and looking for an adnventure.  Can tend to be frustrating.",4
32,"When I first got this game, I found it to be boring not too soon after getting it. When I play it today, I still think it's boring! WWF War Zone is the first real WWF wrestling game to be released on the Playstation. I don't really consider the In Your House game to be wrestling wise, but more Mortal Kombat like.War Zone is based off the WWF roster from late 1997 to early 1998, featuring only the most popular stars in the game . Among the wrestlers in this game, you can choose to play as Stone Cold Steve Austin, Shawn Michaels, Bret Hart, The Undertaker, The Rock, Triple H, Mankind, Goldust, Owen Hart, Ahmed Johnson, Farrooq, British Bulldog, Ken Shamrock, and The Headbangers.The opening of the game is cool, as you're given a Raw like intro that used to open Monday Night Raw back in the mid to late 90s. From there on, you're taken to the menu screen that's in the form of an elevator. In the menu you can look at the wrestlers' biographies that let you listen to their theme and see their attires they wear in the game. There's also a Training mode on the menu that lets you pick a wrestler and learn how to perform their moves before you go into the game.Once you enter the game, you can either play Exhibition matches to get adjusted to everything or go straight to Challenge Mode. Among the match types available are Singles, Tag Team, Tornado Tag Team, Hardcore, or Steel Cage. The Steel Cage match is probably the most frustrating match to play. When you climb the cage, I didn't know what button to push to climb down. I pushed down but I just ended up climbing back down to the ring. I lost most of the Cage matches.Challenge Mode involves you choosing a superstar to play as and guide them to the World Championship. Unfortunately this was a boring and irritating mode to play. Once you play one match, you've played them all. You have to fight the same opponents at least 4 or 5 times before you advance to newer ones. As you progress through, you'll be met by a woman in a limo in the parking lot who will either show interest you for winning a match or insult you for losing a match. Oh yeah, that's another thing. If you lose 1 or 2 matches, you're automatically sent back to the beginning and have to start over from match 1 to go up. It ultimately screws you over and you're forced to play a lot of the same boring matches again.Overall: I found War Zone boring then and I find it boring now. In my opinion In Your House is more fun to play than this. Even the sequel game to War Zone, Attitude, is more fun to play than War Zone. So if you don't want to be bored, skip War Zone and buy In Your House or Attitude instead",2
33,"I enjoy the shows and PPVs. this one is a great one to get if you like wwf wrestling .",5
34,"I liked all of the tricks you can play being a kid. I like being a kid rather than an adult sometimes. The boards look cool.",5
35,"I love the Nintendo 64! I still play some games occasionally and this one was always a fun one. It will frustrate you though!",5
36,"hard to find game most anywhere and only had the opportunity to rent it a while back and wanted to play again. a lot like D and D I was told.",4
37,"Great game!",5
38,"Not one of the best games. I would have rather played Mario just once. I only play it for about two minutes. I fall asleep afterward.",2
39,"I'm so glad I was able to buy this game at a great price. I really enjoyed reliving my childhood.",5
40,"Well let&#8217;s end the Crash Bandicoot trilogy on PlayStation with Crash Bandicoot 3: Warped. This game was released in 1998 and was once again, developed by Naughty Dog, published by Sony Computer Entertainment and distributed by Universal Interactive Studios. It was originally a PlayStation exclusive but was later re-released as a PS One Classic on the PlayStation Store.The game&#8217;s story takes place immediately after the events of the second game in which the ruins of the Cortex Vortex come crashing down to Earth and lands on a temple unleashing an evil entity known as Uka Uka who is Aku Aku&#8217;s evil twin brother; Aku Aku is the mask that helped Crash out in the first two games. Uka Uka joins with Doctor Neo Cortex and Doctor Nefarious Tropy as they plan to gather Crystals in their original places in time and use their energy to enslave the Earth.The game is once again a platformer with pretty much the same kind of controls as the second game. You can not only play as Crash but also as his sister Coco who was a supporting character in the second game. You travel back and forward in time to gather the 25 Crystals from the previous game in their original places in time before the enemy does; but don&#8217;t worry, the levels are completely different from each the second game. The game takes place in the Time-Twisting Machine which acts as the hub area of the game. The machine is split into five chambers with only the first chamber being available at the start. Each chamber has five buttons that open portals to different levels. The goal is the same as the second game; obtain the crystal hidden in the area. Some crystals can be obtained in the middle of the level or by completing a certain task such as winning a race. The gems are also back and can only be obtained by destroying all the boxes, or completing a hidden level or task. Once you obtain the five crystals in a chamber, a sixth button will appear that warps you to a boss who will fight you in order to get the crystals back. By defeating the boss, the next chamber will become available to play. By defeating a boss you unlock a new power, there&#8217;s the Super Slam which makes your body slam more powerful, the double jump, a tornado twister which lets you glide for a short period, a bazooka launcher which can be used to destroy crates or enemies or collect fruit and one ups and the running shoes which allow you to sprint.The newest main feature in the game is the &#8220;Relics&#8221; which can only be retrieved in a time trail mode for every level in the game. After you obtain a level&#8217;s crystal, you can go back to the level and collect the yellow clock at the beginning to start a time trail. The goal is to reach the end as fast as you can, but there are some differences: There are yellow time boxes that when destroyed will stop the clock for a short period of time, there are no checkpoint boxes so if you die, you have to start the level from the beginning; but there are plenty of Aku Aku masks to help you and that&#8217;s pretty much it. It proves to be very challenging and getting the Platinum relics is insanely difficult and even I never managed to get all of them.This game proves to be the best one in the entire series and one of my favorite games overall, period. I would highly recommend getting this game off the PlayStation Store for $6, this is a MUST PLAY. It really is one of the best.FINAL RATING:  10 out of 10",5
41,"I like this game but its not really fun its kinda boring. Its really confusing the game when you die you have too start over but i dont think you can press save. 5/10",3

As i've turned from kid to teen, from teen to young adult and some day to old man, the nostalgia and memory of my childhood in the '90s becomes ever more appealing to me.

48,"I was worried about getting this but I did anyways because I have been after it for a long time. I was worried because it was Used-Acceptable but it has played great so far (though I haven't gotten very far yet) So so far I am so glad I went ahead and ordered it.",5
49,"Love this game. Although the graphics aren't the best since it's N64 and earlier on.... I enjoy everything about it (still keeping in mind the limitations of the time such as the 'invisible walls' and oddly prism shaped bottles etc). The story is well done and unlike other Zelda games, all of the items are used. There were some early on copies with a song/chanting in the fire temple that got taken out in later copies because some people got offended by that and the mirror shield (I have one such copy) but even with that in mind, it's still an amazing game with great music and it sort of ties all of the zelda games together like a central hub. It all comes down to this game.... definitely worth your time to play.",5
50,"What can I say about this game? I bought it to replace one that was stolen when I was a kid. It's great to hear those classic sound effects and that legendary music. EPIC.",5
51,"One of the best video games ever.Redefined everything after it.My copy came in very good condition without scratches or writing",5
52,"The best game for the N64. if you are to have 5 games for the system it needs to be Mario 64, Mario Kart, Smash Bros, Banjo Kazooie, and Zelda",5
53,"I remembered a time my older brother borrowed this game from a friend of his. I liked it so much but when it came to the time for my brother to give it back i was upset. But no worries I was 7 at the time when that happened now that I'm older i was able to buy my own copy.",5
54,"This game is fun, but it is very overrated. It has not aged very well, and the game feels sloppy, compared to how revolutionary it was when it came out.",3
55,"The second one was the best in the series for me, still this was a good flick and many others just went off the deep end.  The newest one is by far the best in the series and a complete re-invention.",3
56,"Anyone who likes 007 would enjoy this game. great first person shooter! I will enjoy playing this game. The game play is a bit strange and hard to get use to because the aim and movement joysticks should be switched. The c pad on the N64 controller is hard to move with. Great game with practice!",5
57,"no idea to say about that have same with twisted metal 2-4 and twisted metal small brawl I haven't play for long time",5
58,"thank you for having this game and in its good conditionyou have increased my collection of games by one",5
59,"It's decent but probably the worst in the series. The level design is very poor and I dislike most of the characters. I'd recommend any other Twisted Metal besides this one.",3
60,"IF you're a collector then go for it, if not then this game is just more of the same.  It's still OK though.",3
61,"this is one old school fun game to fight against your friends.  you can not create any thing.  hours of fun from royal rumble to regular matches and there is quite a bit of people to play as.",5
62,"I should probably review some modern games while I'm here, but I've been kinda GTA'ed out recently, so I decided to put the PS3 away for a minute and bring up some old games from the past to see if they're just as fun as I remember them as.  One of those titles was WCW/nWo Revenge.Released during WCW's heyday (and roughly a few months before WCW's eventual downfall), the game showcases an astoundingly deep roster for game that came out in the 90s.  A total of 63 WCW/nWo wrestlers were divided up into different factions:  WCW 1 (main-event wrestlers), WCW 2 (mid-card wrestlers), WCW 3 (opening match wrestlers), WCW 4 (Cruiserweight wrestlers), nWo White, nWo Red, and Raven's Flock.  Further, there were roughly a dozen or so other wrestlers listed under the imaginary EWF and DAW leagues included in the game; these wrestlers were modeled after Japanese wrestling stars but had their likenesses changed to avoid copyright issues.The controls of the match are simple enough for anyone to jump in and learn, but you have to understand the psychology of wrestling (and use the controls accordingly) if you want to go deep into the championship modes of the game.  Players use the B button to strike, A button to initiate a grapple, the d-pad to move, and the joystick to either taunt or execute a special move.  The player can differentiate between a weak strike/grapple and a strong strike/grapple by holding the respective button down until the move is executed.  The more ""worn down"" your opponent is, the better chances you have of successfully hitting them with a strong attack.  Yet if you try to initiate a strong grapple on an opponent who's not worn down, they'll likely reverse the attack and counter with one of their own.  So much like real wrestling, you have to wear your opponent down with the weak attacks until you move up and hit them with the strong ones (and also like wrestling, it's a good idea to generate a response from the audience by letting out a taunt while your opponent's down.)  Once your spirit meter is full, you can strike an opponent with a special move by initiating a strong grapple and then moving the joystick (or alternately using the joystick when on the turnbuckle if the finisher's an aerial maneuver.)  The controls also allow you to run, leave the ring, block/counter an attack, dodge an attack, and set your focus on another opponent if you're involved in a handicap or tag team scenario.The game has several modes:  Championship, Exhibition, and Special Modes.  The exhibition mode is a singles or tag team match where the player can face either the computer, a friend, or a few friends since the game supports up to 4 players.  The championship modes allow the player to compete for the WCW TV Championship, the WCW Cruiserweight Championship, the WCW Tag Team Championship, the WCW United States Championship, and the grand-daddy of them all, the WCW World Heavyweight Championship (affectionately referred to as the Big Gold Belt.)  While the path to the Television titles and the Cruiserweight titles aren't terribly challenging, you will need to bring your ""A"" game when competing for the higher-tiered titles (or you can dial the difficulty down to Easy, either or.)  The special modes essentially allow the player to engage in specialty handicap or battle royal exhibition matches; with the former allowing for 2-on-1 or 3-on-1 battles while the latter will have 4 competitors fighting each other in the ring until one's eliminated, with the option to allow up to 40 contestants to enter the match.  You're also given a mode where you can customize the given wrestlers to either have different names or to have them wear different costumes.The upside to the game is that it's still fun to play, even 15 years later.  As I said earlier, anyone can pick up the controllers and jump in, while the subtle nuances of the game don't take much effort to figure out as you go along.  The soundtrack is limited but I don't ever think anyone confused WCW's entrance music with the music that Jim Johnston (of WWE fame) has released over the years (with the only exception being Goldberg's theme.)  The graphics were a work in progress considering where the franchise was at by the time WWF No Mercy was released, but it was still leaps and bounds better than what most expected from the gameplay of other systems at the time (as a reminder, this game was released for a console that is three generations removed from what's available today.)  If there was one drawback from the game, it's the limited gaming options that exist.  Once you beat the championship mode, that was essentially it as far as beating the game was concerned.  There were no steel cage match options, tag teams were limited to 2-on-2 action, and the create-a-wrestler option wouldn't be introduced until THQ/AKI began releasing titles for WWF.  Other gripes I have are that you can't seemingly control whether or not someone interferes on your behalf and the fact that the CPU can ""Hulk up"" their spirit meter rather effortlessly while the player has to do all the little things right to make that possible.With all that said, however, the game's fun factor makes it a legitimate ""must have"" for wrestling fans and should be considered by N64 fans who are looking for a beat-em-up button-masher where the top prize is the WCW Championship.  I recommend this to N64 gaming fans, wrestling fans, and people who watched wrestling ""when it was cool.""",4

68,"This is one of the best games ever made for the N64 console.It will always be a reminder of my younger years and my kids love it.",5
69,"This is easily the best game I've ever played.  I played it back when it was first released for the N64 and at the time there was nothing else like it on any of the other platforms. It led the way for 3d gaming which is of course the norm now.  To this day I still get nostalgic and pop the cartridge in on occasion just to run around in the various worlds. The graphics still look pretty good and the game play is still fun.  A simply incredible game.",5
70,"the only SHUMP on the 64 i figured i'd check it out... it plays like a genesis game with crude 3D backgrounds. not very interesting to look at. if you want SHUMP there's only one system for you and it's called the dreamcast. this one you can pass on.",2
71,"I've had a great time with this one, you can pick from 3 alternative but well balanced ships, play with a comfortable control scheme, rake high scores and combos, use powerful special weapons, collect and preserve power-ups by staying alive, deflect shots by doing rolls and are complimented with a remarkable, engaging soundtrack. The power-ups are what make this game stand out because the ships seem to upgrade almost endlessly until you're firing more powerful and voluminous attacks.I mentioned the controls before: between the D-pad, rolling with the right-shoulder button, firing special attacks with the left-shoulder and B buttons and keeping hold on the A button and firing strategically to maintain a shot combo, it's fun and easy to use. That being said, the missions in Vanishing Earth aren't easy by any means because you need to avoid hitting ships as well as being fired on and the bosses are particularly adept at relentlessly firing at you.However, players are offered consolation in that they can continue from the beginning of the mission after losing and can store a password if they'd like (personally, I enjoy staring over from the beginning so I can keep all the power-ups I earn). And even if you don't want to play the whole game, there's a fast 2 or 5 minute arcade-style mode where you earn as high a score as you can destroying enemy vessels with maximum power upgrade from the start.I had a lot of fun switching off with a friend but it's good for single player as well. Not as flawless as Super Star Soldier and I mean that particularly with regard to the visuals of the area you fly over not being as outstanding but overall it still looks good enough not to harm the fun; Vanishing Earth is also much easier to collect for than its TurboGrafx counterpart. If you can get the cartridge around 15 - 20 dollars, I say go for it because there's hours of enjoyable content that will leave you coming back for more.",5

The disc seems to be in great condition with no scratches and plays perfectly. There's a few tiny &#34;cracks&#34; within the inner ring of the disc, but this is common and DOES NOT affect the actual disc itself. It seems like an alright game to me, just not my style, which is why I gave it a 4/5. But a lot of people seem to like this game. It's a great kids game as well.",4

82,"So I was seting up for the next stream and then I found this lying around, I started to remember ""Oh man this game was a lot of fun"" so I started to play it again and it still is fun today. So here I am sitting here on Amazon.com and figured ""well since my next stream is going to be for a Playstation game why not this first?""MediEvil is a hack and slash game involving the undead, but unlike popular games that involves zombies in some way like Resident Evil this one is less....realistic. The game has a cartoon feel and the back of the box even says that, I usually love cartoons and this one fits the bill in terms of both comedy and graphics. The story is that there is this story teller for a king who kind of went off the deep end by saying he slain an evil wizard named Zarok. Zarok, who overhears this, decideds to declare war and horrified by this and believing in Fortesques (the story teller) story he sends him out to battle but Daniel goes down at the first shot with a welhelm scream and everything. 100 years later Zarok returns but so does Fortesque but this time the cowardly knight is a skeletal one.MediEvil's controls are a little awkward but once you get the hang of them it becomes quite nice, the atmosphere of this game is dark and gritty but not too much. As I said before the gameplay is a hack and slash type thing like God of War but less gory... much, much, much, much, MUCH less gory than that game and it does throw around puzzles. The game does beg for you to get every single chalice (collectables) by throwing in a lot of challenges that can make it easier to complete if you have a certain weapon such as enemies having an insane amount of health and would take literally forever to kill with your second to strongest sword. Because of this getting a 100% on this game is really easy and there is no bad ending for doing a No Chalice run if you so wish to do so.The music is outstanding and some of it is memorable, one of my favorite tracks is the ending theme of this one, the music is compose of a synthesizer and other normal instruments.So how would I rate this game, well I think this game is perfect and is and always on the number one spot of my top ten list of favorite games of all time. For that this game gets a 10/10 stars from me, music, gameplay, and graphics are always great and the controls are a bit awkward as I said but once you get used to it then this game is a blast. ALL HAIL SIR DANIEL FORTESQUE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",5
83,"As part of the core Team at SONY Computer Entertainment that worked on the development of the Crash series, and helped propel Naughty Dog into the Video Game Industry as a premier Developer, with these million seller Crash games. I'm proud of what we did, and I STILL enjoy the Crash Bandicoot gameplay and graphics. Buy them up folks. I had to buy these because my little girl gave my copies to her little friends back in the '90s. I hadn't given it much thought until now, and realized that I just had to have my own copies again. Yes, I STILL have PlayStation 1, 2, & 3 consoles and WILL buy the second generation PS-4.",5
84,"Let&#8217;s go back in time to one of my favorite PlayStation icons: Crash Bandicoot. For those who don&#8217;t know, Crash Bandicoot is a fictional Eastern Barred Bandicoot who was genetically enhanced by the evil Doctor Neo Cortex who then escaped and set out to stop the evil scientist and his plans. Crash would appear in many games, but the ones I hold dear are the original three on the first PlayStation: Crash Bandicoot, Crash Bandicoot 2: Cortex Strikes Back and Crash Bandicoot 3: Warped. With that said, let&#8217;s take a look at the first one in the series.The first Crash Bandicoot game was released way back in 1996 with Naughty Dog developing the game, Sony Computer Entertainment publishing it and Universal Interactive Studios being the distributors. It was a PlayStation exclusive, but would eventually get re-released as a PS One Classic on the PlayStation Store to be played on the PlayStation 3. The game is definitely kid friendly and appropriate for all ages, Crash Bandicoot is basically a Mario ripoff but a very good one none the less who came up with several original ideas. The story goes that Crash Bandicoot was created by Doctor Neo Cortex and his henchmen Doctor Nitrus Brio. Crash escapes the experiments but leaves his girlfriend Tawna in the process and Crash is swept up to an island and sets out to go rescue her and stop the villains. What&#8217;s weird is that this is the only Crash Bandicoot game on the PlayStation in which Tawna appears in, I don&#8217;t know why though, it&#8217;s definitely unusual. But nonetheless, let&#8217;s continue with the game.The first thing that stands out are the graphics, the graphics for 1996 looked fantastic, they were even better than Super Mario 64 on Nintendo 64 which was released a month later. It definitely gets an A+ for presentation. The game was a huge hit and was the first non-Japanese game to achieve commercial success in the country. Now, let&#8217;s discuss the actual gameplay.The game is nonetheless a platformer in which you control Crash Bandicoot across three islands to defeat Doctor Cortex and rescue your girlfriend. The game is split into levels with one basic goal: get to the end without dying. You start out with four lives and its one hit deaths from being touched by enemies or falling into water or a pit. Yeah, it&#8217;s weird how water kills Crash even though he fell in the water at the introduction and was floating away to one of the islands and survived. Why is it that these characters who are very athletic can&#8217;t figure out how to swim? I hate games that do this because when you see water, you&#8217;re never sure if the game will allow you to swim. It&#8217;s stupid and what&#8217;s weird is that in the third game Crash does swim underwater with scuba gear. So really the game is a huge contradiction of itself.You can get more one ups by finding them across levels or collecting 100 apples which are basically the coins of Super Mario Bros, but the apples are everywhere in this game so it&#8217;s really easy to get a one up, you could literally get at least three lives per level. Attack moves include jumping in the air and landing on an enemy or using a spin move in a tornado fashion to knock enemies off-screen, I like that, even if it&#8217;s a rip-off of Super Mario World. You also find this Mask that helps you on your journey, if you find it, it gives you an extra hit point, but you don&#8217;t actually wear the mask it just follows you. If you get three masks without losing one, you turn invincible for a brief time much like the Starman&#8217;s in Super Mario Bros.The boxes are also a rip-off of Super Mario Bros. in which they have question marks on them and you have to destroy the boxes to gain prizes. But not all boxes are the same, there are boxes without question marks, arrow boxes that propel you in the air, boxes with exclamation marks which makes boxes appear out of nowhere, checkpoint boxes that act as a save spot for the level and TNT boxes which explode after three seconds when you jump on them, whatever you do, don&#8217;t spin attack them because they will immediately explode.A strange feature in these boxes is that you can get Tawna tokens that act as a bonus level so you can get some extra fruit and one ups. What&#8217;s weird is that Tawna is in this level but she doesn&#8217;t let you rescue her for some odd reason, but what&#8217;s even stranger is that completing the bonus level is the only way to save the game or get a password. I don&#8217;t understand why early PlayStation games didn&#8217;t allow you to save anytime you want. Every video game that can support a memory card should do that, I hate writing down passwords so I can continue. But the password is only eight digits and the main buttons on the PlayStation controller act as the characters so it&#8217;s at least not a long and annoying password.If you complete an entire level without losing a life and manage to destroy all the boxes, you&#8217;ll get rewarded with a gem, this was a flaw with the game because it makes the game way too damn hard and every future Crash Bandicoot game let you get the gem even if you die as long as you break all the crates. Some gems can act as platforms to help you get across areas that are impossible to reach, much like the vine in Super Mario Bros.Now while this game has some flaws, it&#8217;s still a good game overall, it&#8217;s not as good as the second and third game, but it&#8217;s definitely fun and enjoyable. The creativity is good, has a good challenge and the graphics are fantastic. If you have a PlayStation Network account, give this game a chance, it&#8217;s only $6 on the PlayStation Store so it&#8217;s not expensive or anything. It&#8217;s definitely a classic.FINAL RATING:  8 out of 10",4
85,"On hog ride. People has misplaced faces and they look like they took drugs. This game sucked. :) Sonic is better!!!",2
86,"Having helped bring the series to fruition back in the '90s I had a tremendous opportunity to see and play them. The Developer, Naughty Dog had a great idea, and we at SONY helped them succeed. I love the gameplay, the graphics, the music and the humor. Lots of great animations and funny sounds, such as: &#34;Oombadegha!&#34;. You'll just have to play the game to find out what I'm talking about. I'm proud to have been a part of the success of this series. The REAL tribute goes to the millions of you gamers who bought the game and enjoyed the fruits of our labor of love. Oombadegha!",5
87,"This is where the Crash Bandicoot games got really, really good. Everything that the first game got wrong; the second game got it right. The second game was released in 1997 as a PlayStation exclusive called Crash Bandicoot 2: Cortex Strikes Back; obviously reference to Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back. This game is also available on the PlayStation Store as a PS One Classic to be played on either the PlayStation 3, PlayStation Portable or PlayStation Vita for only $6 so I&#8217;d recommend getting that version if you are interested. Developed by Naughty Dog, published by Sony Computer Entertainment and distributed by Universal Interactive Studios, the second game was better than the first game in pretty much every way. The second game takes place immediately after the first one as Doctor Neo Cortex survives the battle against Crash in the first game and decides to use crystals to power the Cortex Vortex to take over the Earth. He decides to abduct Crash Bandicoot to gather the crystals making him believe he wants to use the crystals to save the Earth. We also meet Crash&#8217;s sister Coco who is suspicious of Cortex&#8217;s true intentions. Meanwhile, Doctor Nitrus Brio who was Cortex&#8217;s right hand man wants Crash to gather gems so he could destroy Cortex and the Cortex Vortex orbiting Earth so we are presented with many people wanting to side with us, all with different intentions.The gameplay is a platformer in which you control Crash Bandicoot across 30 levels to gather crystals and gems. The game takes place in a series of six &#8220;Warp Rooms&#8221; which as the hub areas of the game. Each Warp Room contains five portals leading to a level. The goal of the level is to obtain crystals and gems throughout the path. Crystals are placed somewhere along the path whereas gems are obtained by either destroying all the crates, or in bonus levels or secret levels; once you obtain the crystal or gem, you have to reach the end of the level, if you exit the level by using the start menu with a crystal, you will lose it. I guess they made it that way to be hard. Once you obtain all five crystals in a Warp Room, you then have to ride the platform in the center of the room to move to the next Warp Room, however you have to fight and defeat a boss character before gaining access. Ripper Roo is back as a boss who is one of the more interesting bosses as he goes from a genius scientist to a mentally unstable psychopath when Crash hurts him, I can&#8217;t help but laugh at this. Then there&#8217;s the fight with Tiny Tiger across floating platform that drop, the goal is to have Tiny be on that platform when it drops and in true cartoon fashion he floats in the air for about a second and then falls, I love that. I was kind of disappointed that the final boss fight was too easy, but whatever.The gameplay is like the first game except with new controls, Crash can now slide across the ground, perform a body slam, crawl on all fours and even slide across the ground and jump immediately to reach higher places. Some enemies can only be defeated by one of these methods so the game has strategy which is nice. The boxes are back which once again have to be broken in order to obtain extra lives and gems. But what&#8217;s nice is you can die and still get the gem without having to restart the level like with the first game. A new famous box is the Nitro Boxes which explode upon any physical contact, but fortunately there is a green colored box with an exclamation mark on it that will explode all the Nitro Boxes in the level once struck. The game also features bonus levels which contain hidden boxes, extra lives and even gems.As a kid, I played the s*** out of this game. It was only recently I managed to beat it 100% because it is both challenging and fun, but it&#8217;s easier than the first game so if you were expecting a greater challenge, you will be disappointed, but the controls, smoother gameplay and the fact you can save anytime you want as long as you are in the Warp Room makes this game a far superior game than the first one.FINAL RATING: 9.5 out of 10",5
88,"This game is a lot of fun! The environments are adorable and the gameplay is a lot of fun. There is quite a bit of stuff to do and the game is kind of challenging. My only problem is the movement is a little goofy feeling at first, but you will get used to it.",4
89,"Overall, it's a pretty good game. 1 star taken off because it does not feature the original soundtrack, and because of this many levels are silent or have different music. another star taken off because of load times, the graphics, lag (come on, no amount of enemies should make a game like this lag), and the censoring of some levels. Also, no 2-player Co-op, only online which is stupid. If you simply MUST have it on PSX then you'll enjoy it, if not then just buy the PC version.",2
90,"To begin this review firsthand if you're the hi-res FPS and all those sophisticated functions make you happy?then by all means enjoy.The graphics are 2D and you can't duck behind rocks to shoot or yield two weapons at a time...this is old-school baby!So 'why rate this game so highly' you might ask?well here's why I like this particular Doom...*You'll get Ultimate Doom and Doom II(which was a dynamite sequel) with 50+ levels...that's a lot of game time.*Doom in general is just pulsing with atmosphere:from a listening perspective you can hear the monsters growling or the raspy sounds of the Imps down the hall which does mess with your head especially if they're blindsiding you.Flickering lights,stumbling into a room that's completely and full of monsters,or hitting a switch that unleashes a ton of monsters...defend yourself or die!The dark mood that Doom provides is very thick for early 90's fare.*Some people think for an old game like this there's lifeless brown or grey colored levels on flat land without even playing it...not true.Pentagrams everywhere,corpses impaled,walls made from flesh,scrolling walls made from intestines.I think it's the eighth level on Doom I you meet the barons of hell in the center a star-shaped room that's like a temple most unexpectedly...caught me completely off guard first time I ever played Doom and never forgot it.That's one thing about the older Doom games,chockful of surprising moments!*The enemies of Doom I were good but Doom II they just added more to the roster that were literally far tougher and could kill you quick if you weren't on your toes.Mass quantities of monsters coming at you at once as the Doom series I always found to possess the most intense battles you'll come across on a FPS game.That's not to call any of the newer games weak but by going 2D but ID Software was just able to dish out much more when it came to traps and high volume monster shooting.Conclusion:The controls were decently laid out,audio remastering did the trick,as far as I'm concerned this the inquiry of 'if it's as good or better than the PC version or not' because it's an obsolete game graphics wise.The framerate is pretty smooth to me and the graphics are spot on to me.A bad version of Doom was for the Sega 32X that was a very stripped down and clearly stuck out like a sore thumb to the PC version.The PS1 Version is an awesome alternative and is worth having....5-stars!",5
91,"Graphically, Jet Moto is one of the worst games I've played for the PS1. I prefer the second Jet Moto over this one. It's extremely hard, you only get boost refills once a lap, and the computer controlled players try their best to wreck you. Just an overall frustrating experience.",3
92,"If only the movie was as good.  I've missed playing this game so much, glad to have it back in my collection.",4
93,"This brought back so many memories. The godfather of all games. This is a must have for any avid game collector.",5
94,"I played this on my PS1 shortly after it came out and really enjoyed it. The games graphics, use of pre-rendered backgrounds and creephy atmosphere were far superior to other such games and made for an unforgettable experience.  Unfortunately the game hasn't aged well especially the graphics. They're low resolution and blocky when compared to today's and can make revisiting the game a less than stellar experience. If you're considering playing this I strongly recommend you consider playing the RESIDENT EVIL REMAKE instead.  It's far superior to the original in every way possible. If you really want to play the original game than by all means do so but I found it difficult revisiting it after playing the superior remake.",5
95,"this is a pretty good game except for the music gets annoying sometimes such as the B1 floor of the mansion however the disc had a few scratches it was in good condition ..",4
96,"Soul Blade is the very first game in the Soul Caliber series. I guess it was Soul Blade in the arcade and became Soul Caliber years later for the Dreamcast and they decided just to go with that from then on. It's quite a classic in my opinion. That's actually why I bought it because to be honest the game play has aged a bit and there are much tighter fighting games out there now. It's still a great game to have though. Aside from being the arcade game there is also a weapons master mode in which you select a character and play out a story where you travel the land acquiring new weapons in search of the legendary Soul Blade. If you were into arcade fighting games in the 90's then you should probably have this.",5
97,"like play game as fun and enjoy. haven't play for long time and final get so like play what I can say that all",5
98,"Being a long time Twisted Metal fan this game would have to be my favorite in the series. Amazing Soundtrack, Great level design, unique characters, and an overall fun experience, especially with friends. I highly recommend this to any fan of action games.",5
99,"The title says it all, better than the first and third.  TM Black was good but ultimately it will take a lot to revive the series.",5
100,"Do you remember sitting behind the steering wheel at the arcade and playing this game? I know I do! Brings back a lot of memories!",5
101,"a fun game to battle against your friends.  up to 4 players can play at a time.  this is one fun game to have.",5
102,"There's a strong case for this title being N64's most replayable, with a heart rivaled only by Zelda. The arcade and score-based gameplay alone means competitive revisits, and you can absorb a complete experience in a reasonable timeframe, like a good TV show. Even with the kid friendly premise, there is a sense of true emotion between the characters. You care about Fox, his team, and the strife they encounter. Most of all, this game has yet to be topped for its kind - the closest they got was the 3DS remake, but even that isn't a whole new game (plus the voices were way better in this one).",5
103,"Was glad to find it.  It works great.  Still playing it.  I was hoping I would get as much enjoyment out of it as when I was younger and I DO.  Great replay value.",5
104,"Finer words have never been spoken. StarFox 64 was the long awaited American sequel to the original StarFox for the SNES (Japan got StarFox 2 on SNES while us Americans had to wait for StarFox 64). Excellent game, superb 3D graphics and for the love of Michael Douglas, play with the RUMBLE PACK!",5
105,"This game is so much fun! This is where it all started this game is one of the best mario parties. There's 6 characters who are arguably to this day still the most popular mario characters. There's 50 minigames and 8 fantastic boards!",5
106,"miss play game for long time I haven't play so now final get and play as enjoy. alright thumb up",5
107,"This game had the potential to be great, but the controls were very difficult to maneuver with, as your thumbs will become very sore after trying to move your character with the D-pad for however long you play the game. If you can find yourself a specialized D-Pad for fighting games, or one that can override the Dualshock analog limitations, than you just may be good to go, but you can easily take a lot of damage, and you can't save anywhere like you would be able to if you played any of the Doom games, or Quake. If you want something that will scare the jeepers out of you, then go ahead and play this, but if you want a comfortable game with horror elements, I think you are better off playing Doom 3, Silent Hill, the original Quake or Resident Evil 1-3.These are my two cents.",2
108,"I enjoy watching Tom Cruise do some interesting things in some of the strangest places. Walk around the hotels and things. It is much better than James Bond. It doesn't have all of the gun sounds droning around. Go to the restroom or the bar.",5
109,"I always wondered why I could never beat this game and as a 22 year old adult I figured it out...This game is hard! I will not post any spoilers but this game has done an awesome job with the technology available at the time of it's creation and GTA takes homage to it and based gameplay similarities off it. Anyway, there are not many games in today's day that makes games like this. It creates the atmosphere that you are under an imminent threat and you are never alone but at the same time it's only you that lies between a saved planet and destruction. If you haven't played this game but want to play older games, I would highly recommend this. If you are like me and haven't beaten this game..Give yourself that satisfaction and DO IT!",5
110,"Where do I begin? The graphics are top-notch for the time it was released, and the environments vary from being colorful to plain dark with a very fitting soundtrack that hums perfectly with its perspective locations, and the controls are pretty solid, and you can even use the analog stick, which is pretty neat for a game that was originally released in Japan in 1998 with a 1999 US release. The enemies can be rather creepy, which adds to the overall appeal of it. The story is rather entertaining with plot twists that will keep the player going, and the idea of mist being such a poisonous element to the world seems interesting in itself as there are some deserted towns that were deserted from the movement of such a lethal element. The battles have various combinations that characters can use to defeat opponents, and some of the bosses will require having special moves to defeat them, as they can rake up in difficulty very quickly. Overall, I highly recommend this game to any RPG fan looking for an original story with exciting gameplay. My two cents.",5
111,"Now I can play four man matches in WWF No Mercy without considerably low frame rate and lag. Great product and shipped fast.",5

114,"I still remember as a kid on my Birthday when my Dad bought me a N64 with a bunch of games including Donkey kong & a few months ago I bought the N64 from one of my old friends and a while after I bought Donkey kong and other games at a flea market but I had forgotten that to play Donkey Kong it required the Expansion Pak so I came here Bought it hoping that it would arrive and surely it did, all it came in was in one of those Orange envelope things & it wasn't even wrapped in anything when I opened it it was just right there but it's cool cause at least the inside was insulated with Bubble wrap, kept it safe & it looked Brand New. I'm just Happy now that I can play again one of the games I played when I was like around 8 years old and now I'm 19.",5
115,"I loved playing this game back in 1999, so I decided to buy it to have it on my game collection. This game has lots of action, stealth, strategy and the plot is awesome! Id recommend it!",5
116,"No complaints here, some parts of it became rather frustrating however.  A nice venture into a new series, too bad it was slowed down by poor story telling in later games.",5
117,"I have to say that although this game does not include Gannon or Zelda... It is one of my favorite Zelda games. I love the story line, I feel like you get to know the characters much better. It's like playing a book which is how Zelda games, the good ones, tend to feel to me. It carries a message too....I don't wish to spoil it but I will hint that link is in a land of dreams plagued by nightmares. Of the game boy Zelda games,  I would recommend this one the most along with minish cap. Even though this is an older one and 2d it still feels more like a 3d one because it pulls you in. It's not too hard but it is a fair challenge (nothing like the originals) and it could be confusing if you don't know anything about Zelda but....for maybe a second Zelda game this is a good choice.",5
118,"I understand that this is an original, but there are some things I didn't quite like with this game. In the Unknown Dungeon, I climbed a set of stairs and then ended up in a wall! I couldn't move anywhere except for out of it and back to the previous level. Eventually I managed to get up without being forced into the wall. Also, most of the game is Blue if played on the Game Boy Color or Advance systems. Gameplay, music, and the story are all extraordinarily great for a Game Boy title.",4

136,"I started playing this game a few months ago and just completed all of it.  Super Mario Bros. Deluxe features not only the 1985 NES original levels, but also the Japanese version levels that North American players couldn't have before.  At that particular time, the only other way that anyone could access those levels was to play Super Mario All Stars for the Super NES/Nintendo Wii.  However, the NES Japanese levels were finally included on this 1999 Game Boy Color port/remake.  (For those of you history buffs, the Japanese version of Super Mario Bros. was actually named Super Mario Bros. 2.  The North American version of SMB2 was completely different and released in 1988 with Wart as the main archvillain, not Bowser.)I actually find the Japanese version of the levels very satisfying and much more challenging.  Some unusual effects will happen, such as Mario/Luigi jumping off a trampoline and into the air off screen for a couple of seconds, entering a ""negative"" warp pipe that brings you back several worlds (i.e., instead of going FORWARD), or seeing Goombas walking in the water levels.Super Mario Bros. Deluxe is one of those games that I could NEVER ever quit playing, even if I wanted to.  So stop reading this already and get this game!! Sadly, Super Mario Bros. Deluxe isn't currently available for download on the Nintendo 2DS/3DS, but it would be very nice if it was.  :)",5
137,"Alpha 3 has a roster that will take you months to master each character. I haven't seen so many Street Fighter characters (31) in one game before for the PS and PS2. The unique feature of this game is the ISM system where you can choose which finisher move you want. The best feature is the World Tour which is practically a Street Fighter RPG (why can't the new Street Fighter games have this?!) where you level up your character as you win matches.",5

144,"Once again we have an example of an Amazon vendor claiming one thing and delivering something else.This CD-ROM did not even come in a protective plastic jacket. I suppose little Tommy's parents wouldn't give him the money to purchase one so he could completely fool the Amazon Dupe customer that he paid good money for a legal copy.",1
145,"Back when I first owned my PlayStation, I tried many games from Blockbuster. I've been a fan of Crash Bandicoot, and actually it was that series that compelled me to choose a PlayStation over a Saturn (thank goodness), so I quickly became of fan of platforming games. Not to mention that I loved Super Mario 64, but, since I didn't own an N64, I was forced to play it only when I visited my cousin's.One day, while browsing my local Blockbuster, my sister saw a cover with monkeys on it. With that and Rugrats, she checked out the counter with my selections, and we went home that day to play games. I don't remember what games I checked out (FFIX?), but Ape Escape was the one title we played together until we had to return it.Her following birthday, I bought it for her. You may think, ""Oh, that's nice,"" but I bought it because I actually wanted to play it...It was the first game I've ever completed in its entirety, and I go back from time to time to replay it, no matter how many times I've caught the monkeys. The sequels are good, but this stands out as the first game to fully require the DualShock controller, and the music in this installment is my favorite in the series.Monkeys have taken over different periods of history, and so it's your job to catch them all and bring down the leader. You get helpful gadgetry along the way, and they're all extremely useful and you'll find yourself using them all to the very end. Sometimes some games give you arsenals that become obsolete a few levels later; not here. Every level can use all your tools.The boss fights are sparse, but the final boss more than makes up for it. It remains one of my most favorite boss battles, though, by today's standards, it's pretty easy.I write this review only a couple weeks after my latest playthrough, and the game still holds up extremely well. I thought that, with my years of gaming experience, catching the monkeys would be a lot easier. While I know most of the game's secrets, and the easier levels were far easier than before, the monkeys still prove a challenge to capture. The patterns for boss fights are easy to get down, and I experienced no degradation in my original copy of the game when playing on a PS3.This game should be a requirement for all PlayStation owners.",5
146,"This is my favorite Duke Nukem game. It's got a ton of levels to explore and the variety in the levels keeps things interesting. I played it when it first came out for the N64 and after beating it traded it. I got nostalgic for it so bought it again last year to play. What a great trip down memory lane. I was taken back to the first time I played it and it was just as fun. The graphics look even better on my 46"" lcd than they ever did on my old tube tv. A great game for those who like older shooters with some humor.",5
147,"I saved my allowance for weeks to buy this game when it first game out. Now that I'm an adult(unless you ask my wife) this game is just as awesome as it was then as it is now. The graphics are a bit old but the storyline is one of the best I have ever seen to date.",5
148,"This is just one of those classic games to find my childhood. It really was one of the best RPG's money could buy and still is. Just look at all the fanfare around the game the reason why people still play and talk about this game.",5
149,"Final Fantasy VII was a major hit in 1997 it was also the first final fantasy game not to be on a Nintendo console. This game has gone on to be without a doubt the most popular final fantasy game if not the most popular jrpg game ever made, and with good reason.If I had any complaints about this game its the fact that the graphics while amazing back in 1997 look a bit dated in 2014 which while some of the other final fantasys might look a little jagged around the edges but the have aged better. Which isn't the games fought or nothing given that company's where still getting the foot on the ground in the whole 3d fad in 1997, but it might turn off other players. Everyone kinda has a legoie look to them. In the battle scenes however are really detailed and graphically hold up today. Now for the music 90% of the games soundtrack is amazing for a psx game its highly catchy and without the music I doubt the game would have been quite as popular as it is today. With that being said there is a few tracks in the game that are hard to listen to but most of it is great.Of Coarse the important part about final fantasy is the story and game play. The story without giving out any spoilers for the few that haven't played it yet, in this game is probably the best we will be able to see in a video game (besides final fantasy 6 and maybe star wars knights of the old republic). What I like about the earlier final fantasy games is that its kinda like reading a book only that your playing and immersed into it. So with that being said I actually preferred this over the newer ones with the voice acting. If your a younger gamer or have kids the may have a hard time getting into a final fantasy game until the have reached the age the can read and perhaps this game can even help them learn or want to learn how to read. Also for newcomers of the series you do not need to play any of the previous final fantasy's to understand the story. Most Final Fantasy's with the exception of the ons that have -2 on them have nothing to do with one another story wise other than a few minor references here and there so if you just want to play one final fantasy you are invited to do that.Game play wise this game is very similar to the previous final fantasys IV-VI with the active time battle. This makes the battles a lot more fun as you can not scroll threw everything all day and get a shower before you make your move. With that being said you do have some time before making a move but you do have to be careful. Anyway this is on of the more easier final fantasys although it is still challenging none of the final fantasys (while maybe 13) are casual friendly and this is no different there is a learning curve however if you don't play games much and are sucked into this on you will learn it eventually. Just might have to start over a time or to.Anyway believe it or not despite popular believe this is not the best final fantasy game. Now it is on of the best and is the best final fantasy game to get started with since its slightly easier but I would recommend playing threw Final Fantasy VI as well since after beating VII I discovered more games in the series and found that this game was a lot more fun although similar plus the story of that game completely sucks you in even more than VII does. Along with the soundtrack of VI is just as great if not better.Anyway even though VI is a better game, although a bit more hardcore. VII is still a great follow up for that game and was the game that got me hooked in the series (although I did played the first on on the old nes back in the day) and is on of the best RPGs ever made anyone into rpgs both western and Japanese ones will be happy with this game as long as there willing to sit threw the outdated graphics, they will find a very fun and likable game with great characters (although this is somewhat where final fantasy started going to stereotypical anime people) and a great story.",5
150,"......that hasn't already been said a million times by a million people. The game is that good , it has without question earned it's place among the top 2 or 3 all time RPG's to date. I played many before and hundreds since and this is the only game that had me invested enough in a character and a story line that when that character died I dropped my controller in shock and a small tear may have found it's way down my cheek. It's a game that , especially at the time of it's release was just that good. If you have had enough interest you found yourself already at this page and remarkably reading my humble review than all I can tell you is....STOP READING NOW AND GO BUY IT.......it is just that damn good. Beware on price though. An original black label version can top $100 in auctions if collecting is your thing , avoid the scammer's asking hundred's. Depending on current market $85 to $125 are about right for the black label one's. If you just want to play it and collecting isn't for you the greatest hits version is more reasonable at $25 to $40 , it's the same game either way and the greatest hits one is a steal in terms of entertainment value.",5
151,"When it comes to an RPG, none can top Final Fantasy. With quests galore, a great story, amazing visuals (considering the time period), and customization that is pretty respectable it still can hold its own against games today. There are even multiple optional characters! (Yuffie and Vincent). For anyone interested in gaming and RPGs this game is a must without a doubt.",5

154,"Follow Claire Redfield of Resident Evil 2 as she searches for her lost brother Chris, only to uncover another sinister plot to unleash a horrible curse on the world in the name of love. Rescue your brother only to be rescued by him. &#34;Code Veronica&#34; made for an awesome pre-Halloween gaming experience, kicking back in a bean bag chair with a bag of candy corn and the lights turned down low. &#34;Code Veronica&#34; is the true third installment in the franchise, but given Capcom's contract with SONY to produce a main-series title on their PlayStation system, their &#34;Nemesis&#34; spin-off took this game's place, and regrettably. &#34;Veronica&#34; is certainly a better game, with a better plot, better graphics, and better gameplay. Additionally, &#34;Veronica&#34; marks the series' last game in the Survival Horror genre before &#34;Resident Evil 4&#34; branched the series into an on-rails pseudo-shooter action-adventure nightmare (no pun intended; this analysis is accurately and justifiably harsh). It is the only game for the DreamCast, all in all, worth playing. It makes little use of the hardware's potential, and is only enjoyable insofar as it is a Resident Evil game.",5
155,"Buy! Best Graphics on the Dreamcast that I've seen, and Fun gameplay to boot!",5

159,"This was Acclaim's sequel to the horrendous 1998 release of War Zone. And while I will say that Attitude was 5x better than War Zone, I won't say that it didn't feature some of the same flaws that War Zone did.I'll start with the goods first. There were a hoard of new match types added to the game. And while I won't list them all, I will say that some of them were a Triple Threat, Fatal 4 Way, Fatal 4 Way Elimination, Handicap, Gauntlet, Stable, Battle Royal, I Quit, Last Man Standing, First Blood, Royal Rumble, King of the Ring, Survivor Series, and many more. The variety was overwhelming and was bound to keep players busy and satisfied for the time being when playing.Another plus to the game was the realistic entrances of the superstars. In War Zone, the entrances only consisted of you seeing the superstars come to the entrance ramp before cutting to the ring. In Attitude, they diligently take time to accurately add a touch of realism to every superstar's entrance. For example, when Undertaker is on his way out, the lights will slowly dim before he makes his entrance. The only thing I don't get is why the entrance way includes steps for them to walk down on. You could also pick from the Raw, Sunday Night Heat, or Custom arena to fight in. This was another cool feature as you could pick the ring skirt, choose the lighting color, the color of the ropes, etc.War Zone's Challenge Mode was replaced with a Career Mode. The superstar you choose to play as starts off on House Shows, trying to work their way up to Raw, then eventually PPVs and earn challenges for the European, Intercontinental, and WWF Championships.Perhaps the most frustrating thing about this game is the gameplay. The moves are slow and extremely hard to perform and sometimes don't even work. How slow you ask? Lets just say that when you try to attempt most moves, it gives your opponent enough time to attack you. The gameplay is what makes the game completely unenjoyable. It's too slow, the simplest moves are too generic and easy to perform and get boring easily and the crowd will let you know their disapproval as well as they begin to boo you.Overall: Attitude is better than War Zone but only in aspects that don't involve gameplay. More options to choose from but the gameplay is probably worse than War Zone where at least in War Zone, most moves were easy to do. I still say that In Your House was the best of the 3 games made from Acclaim. But fortunately this would be their last WWF game they ever made. WWF's next major video game was Smackdown that would be developed by THQ",3
160,"I enjoy seeing the PPV, smackdown and raw. this one is a rare one to get if you like wwe wrestling.",5
161,"I'm a huge fan of the older Resident Evil games and have enjoyed every one however this was my least favorite. I did enjoy exploring Raccoon City but didn't like the forced encounters with Nemesis. The game actually was made to tie up loose ends from Resident Evil 2 which  it did but the story just seemed to be an after thought lacking the attention the developers gave to the previous games.  The game looked great as usual and the developers managed to push the Ps1 hardware further than previous games in regards to graphical effects. The little details like water shooting from fire hydrants, moths around light fixtures and mice running about on the floor as you walked by added to the ambiance.  All in all a fun game though not quite as good as the others in the series.",3
162,"remember playing this as a kid",5
163,"Being a 90s kid, this was a must-have for me and I LOVED this game.  Unfortunately, I lost the disc several years ago and have been without it since, until recently when I purchased a copy from Amazon.  This is undoubtedly the best game I have ever seen, especially for PS1, since most of those games are quick and easy.  Quite the opposite with this game.  I've only gotten halfway through it because the bosses are SO hard.  Try playing Anubis Rex and/or Space Galaxian and you'll see what I'm talking about.  This game may have been released for other game systems, but none retains the quality and feel that the PS1 version does.  (By the way, if you buy this game, Ms. Pac-Man Maze Madness is the perfect complement to this one.  It is also quite complex for a PS1 game.)  Yes, there still are new Pac-Man video games being produced all the time (recently, Pac-Man and the Ghostly Adventures), but none have the feel of this one.",5
164,"Many, many 80's icons of video gaming have tried to make the leap to 3D platformers. Most have failed. Though credit is due to Frogger, who keeps on trying. Keep it up, buddy, you'll get there yet. But outside of the Mario franchise, few pixelated critters have the staying power to stay relavant in todays gaming world. Anyone else waiting for Super Q bert Land?One of the limited exceptions to this rule has been Pac-Man. The worlds first video game character (not counting faceless space ships and tanks), he beat Mario to the sidescroller in Pac-Land, and stared in two adventure games of his own in the SNES days, Pac-Man 2 the New Adventures and Pac in Time. So when the gaming world went 3D in the late 1990's/early 2000's he was primed and ready to make the switch as well.The great thing about the first Pac-Man World is that the developers were able to mix new style game play in with classic elements to create a game that new players and seasoned pros alike could enjoy. The multiple new mazes playable feel like a blast from the past, while the platforming levels that make up the bulk of the game explored what was then new ground in a consistantly entertaining way.  The game established moves for Pac-Man that would carry over into two enjoyable sequels and featured plenty of old favorites like pac-dots, fruit, and those pesky ghosts in new and exciting settings. It also established Pinky as female, before all ghosts were assumed to be guys. (Except for Sue, of course.)Now, if you're only familiar with modern kid-friendly games you might be surprised by the difficulty of this game. Some of the bosses are maddingly hard to defeat, and the amusement park level will make you want to renounce power pellets and stick to zombie hunting. But if you enjoy a challange this can actually be a plus. If not, the Gameboy Advance version plays surprisingly well and doesn't have most of the boss levels.While not my favorite of the &#34;World&#34; trilogy, this was a great continuation of a classic series. Here's hoping that future Pac-games will recapture the magic of this entry.",5
165,"You start to notice what late 90's games in 3D were going for: open level design with large levels to explore. Banjo Kazooie, Donkey Kong 64, and Jet Force Gemini did it. So now comes an M game with the same 3D formula as the other games I mentioned, only you get a more action oriented game with (bad) voice acting (good for the time). You get a pretty decent story that will carry the game along. Most important you get large semi-open levels that you can explore. However, you don't really go through &#34;levels&#34; because the whole game is one big level with small loading screens. But you backtrack whenever you want, which is something you couldn't do if it was broken up into levels. The only area you go to that's kind of a split from the main game is the real world. It's a pretty small area (compared to the dark world you go to for the rest of the game). However you can treat the game like levels if you want because at a certain point you get to an area where a new picture appears in the menu so you can fast travel to whatever ares in the game, like you would if you selected levels. However, you can go back from where you start to a previous area and it acts more like an adventure game. The reason I call the game &#34;semi-open&#34; is because you do go through a very big world with many areas with hardly any load time, but the level design leads you in a kind-of straight path. The reason I say &#34;kind-of straight path&#34; is because you can stray off the path a little by going down another path or exploring the area a little. However it's not open like, say Elder Scrolls, because there are walls on both sides (left and right) of you the whole time. You cannot jump over these walls and explore what's outside of the area so I'd call it semi-open world. It has a similar world structure that Dragon Age Origins has strangely. It's more like a very long straight path kind-of open world with other smaller areas you can explore. If you play the game and compare it to Elder Scrolls and Dragon Age Origins, you'll see what I mean. So it does feel a little confined. But the very large kind-of linear world you travel to is very interesting. Usually the game feels semi-linear because if you just go in a straight direction you can usually proceed through the game. You also occasionally jump off a ledge and go into a circular are with multiple paths you have to go to. Aside from the world, the gameplay is fair. It's better on Dreamcast and PC because the controls are more fluid. On n64, shadowman stops often when you want to turn or face a different direction. So navigating through levels can be irritating. Also, the game is pretty frustrating because enemies take a long time to kill because you only have a pistol with unlimited ammo. You pick up other better guns but their ammo is extremely scarce, as are the guns. The whole supernatural semi-horror thing the gam has going for it, is really cool and interesting. It reminds me of the town in Ocarina of Time with the creepy dead people made out of (mud?) That's what the enemies look like sort-of. The game is overall just very unique and fun, At times it can be quite hard, but it is worth a purchase for the Dreamcast or PC version. The n64 port is pretty inferior but this is the version I have and it is...ok. The ps1 version is apparently god-awful so avoid that verion at all costs. So I would probably give the Dreamcast version 5 stars for more music, more sounds, better more fluid controls, and much better graphics.",4

The console is a classic, but also has so many hidden gems, you can really go to its Wikipedia article and start to drool. Further, with its VMU capability and four ports for controllers it has aged much better than other retro consoles.Games to get with this:Sonic Adventure 1 and 2: Two classic 3D platformers, though 2 has aged much better than 1. They can still be found affordably and playing them on their original console (Dreamcast) gives the best control experience.D2: An obscure horror game that will have you hiding under your bed at night for weeks after playing it. This game made great and novel use of the VMU screenShenmue: Considered one of the best games ever made, with graphics that hold up well even todayChu Chu Rocket: Great puzzle game, with a competitive multiplayer mode for up to four local playersSpace Channel 5: A music game that has you helping a space news reporter (you heard me) dance. Very bizarre, very fun.Crazy Taxi: I cannot do this game justice in my writing. Just go look up Crazy Taxi gameplay online.And so many more.With its second screen in the controller's memory card and its amazing library of games, this console is a boon to own today. Used Dreamcast games are often sold for $10 or less on Amazon, and that means you can quickly build a true library of games for a fraction of the cost.",5
176,"The PlayStation, Playstation2, and Gamecube use memory cards to hold the data of a saved game, but Dreamcast went one step further with the Visual Memory Unit, or VMU for short.

182,"Sonic Adventure was my first Dreamcast game, and to this day it's still in my top-ten of all time favorite games ( on any system ) ever! Two weeks before I picked up Sonic Adventure I saw the demo in a video game store and was "" BLOWN AWAY "" by what I saw. My all time favorite hedge-hog moving so fast that my eyes could hardly keep up with him, and the graphics of 128 bit bliss was awesome indeed! After I brought it home a few weeks later, I was again blown away by the free roaming 3d game-play of this awesome game. Sonic Adventure was ( and is ) so big and so grand, that I find it hard to write just a paragraph on the game, but here it goes. The game takes place on Angel Island, ( a floating island )  and it is somehow connected to a city. You have six players in this awesome game. There's: Sonic the Hedgehog, Miles ""Tails"" Prower, Amy Rose, ( Sonic's love interest ) Knuckles the Echidna, Big the Cat, and E-102 Gamma. ( one of Eggman's robots ) You must stop Eggman from feeding the seven Chaos Emeralds to the evil monster Chaos, also known as "" The God of Destruction. "" The game moves so fast at times it makes one dizzy. ( and try not to barf! ) Besides the "" Adventure Mode "", you have the "" Action Stages "", and the cute lil' Chao's to take care of in the Chao gardens. It's kind of a virtual pet that you can interact with, and you can even download mini games onto the VMU memory card, then take the VMU out of the controller and play the game separately on it. ( cool ) You have many mini games, action stages, power-ups, worlds, and objectives to play in this wonder of a game. It's part Action, RPG, fishing, exploratory, puzzle, racing, shoot-em-up, and fighting game all rolled into one big adventure. ( whew ) If there ever was a game that gave the player 'his or her' money's worth, this game does it well! If there was any complaint I might have, it's that I hate the fishing levels with Big the Cat. ( it's hard as hell to me ) Sonic Adventure for the Sega Dreamcast is one of the best games ever made for this great system. Even NiGHTS into Dreams makes a cameo appearance in the game. ( it's very cool ) So if you're into Sonic, and have a Dreamcast, this game must be in your collection for it to be complete. Yuji Naka and the Sonic team did it again in spades!!! "" Happy Gaming! """,5
183,"I've been loving all the Sonic The Hedgehog games since I was 11 yrs. old. I love the Sonic Adventure game. When I first played the Sonic Adventure game, I had a reaction to the game. My stomach had got weak like I was gonna vomit (throw up). It took me about a month to get used to Sonic Adventure. I like the Casinopolis level where I do the ""Fly through the Rings with Nights"" in the Nights Pinball. Even though, I don't listen to rock music; The Title Screen, Super Sonic Theme/End Credits, Sky Deck level, and Final Egg level have the rock music which it's definitely all that. Also, Windy Valley level - The Air music is similar to the Sega Genesis Sonic 3D Blast's Green Grove Act 1 and Twinkle Park level with Sonic (where you ride the race car) music is similar to the Sonic 3D Blast's Panic Puppet Act 1/Level Select. The Sonic Adventure game is the prettiest and it is definitely all that. Sonic Adventure is a nice game to buy.",5
184,"Sonic Adventure is a game that tries to do way too much. There are six characters and only one (sonic) is decent. Most of the game is boring and the rest is usually to broken to be any fun.The Sonic level's, which should have been the entire game, are plagued with a broken camera (it was on crack, sometimes it would focus inside a wall) and bugs. The boss battles are way to easy, and when you started to pick up speed I felt like the game was playing itself (I tried to fail on the whale level and it was impossible). Plus the sonic story is super short. I didn't really like the other game stories.In the Tails levels you just replay the same levels as sonic but you can fly. The camera and bugs are even worse here.The E-102 Gamma levels are a super generic shoot-em up game.In Knuckles level's you search for gems in a map and is very tiresome.In Amy's level you pretty much just walk around and hit enemies with a hammer, it gets old very fast.I save the worst for last Big the cat. His levels are just a fishing mini-game. There's nothing special at all, just a boring fishing game, way to go sonic team.Most of Sonic adventure you play boring sub characters, and when you do get to play as sonic, it's too short and plagued with too bug to be any fun. This is by far the most overpraised Dreamcast game out there.",2
185,"This game is amazing you should totally buy it i really love this game and i wish there could be a 3 too this cause it deserves one. This game is really really scary but it is worth the money",5
186,"love the game",4
187,"This game was bought and rather farfetched. I hoped it would work and It doesn't play story mode at all. So I'm stuck in training mode and can only play the first training session. A shame.",1
188,"It's games like these that make us nerds love the Dreamcast.Dynamite Cop was one of my favorite arcade games back in the day, and this version brings those memories flooding back; you could call this a perfect port, which is something the Dreamcast has always been very good at. If you're like me and ran to the arcade to play this back when it was around, you'll love this version too. Definite recommendation.To those who haven't played before: you choose from one of three secret agents and fight your way through a pirate-infested cruise ship. I hesitate to call it appropriate for all ages, as there are scary moments, gunfire, and explosions, but as long as your kiddies aren't averse to that, it's pretty tame, and never gory. But other than that, this is arcade beat-em-up action at its finest.",5

191,"I know what you're thinking... I need another controller. The generic can't be that bad, I might not like it, but I'll be able to play.No, you will not. You wll hate every minute of this.As others have said, the buttons are actually ok, but the d-pad will drive you insane. Rage quit-inducing. Don't bother, go out to your local retro store and pick up an actual, old SNES controller. The price will be well worth it. I've pretty much thrown this in the garbage, but I can't seem to bring myself to it for some reason, but it deserves it.",1
192,"I used to play this game for hours at a time when I was younger. I had been looking for it in stores for a long time and I didn't even think about checking here, so when I saw it, I ordered it right away. It has challenges that you have to beat in order to get different levels. It's a great game and I play it for hours at a time.",5

194,"It was early 1998--I think--and I was hanging out with some so-called friends. We were in my school's gym when our discussion turned to the topic of video games. Up `til then my experiences with the gaming industry had been with the NES and Game Gear, with the occasional Game Boy, SNES, and N64 when I visited my cousins. One of my uncles owned almost every major console in the `90s, but he never let us younger nephews touch any of his equipment.Anywho, I was talking with my ""friends"" and they asked me what game system I owned. I replied, ""None. I don't have one,"" rather sheepishly. ""None?"" one questioned, confused. ""Wow; I thought everyone had one."" He promptly shrugged it off though, and continued conversing with the others.But I didn't shrug it off so easily.That night (or some time that week, since my memory fails me), I approached my mother and told her I wanted a video game system. The next day I came home to a PlayStation sitting on the living room entertainment center.Yeah, right.She told me if I wanted one I can buy it myself. I had been saving for a go-kart for a while, but as the years dragged on my interest in one dwindled. I decided to use that saved currency for a system instead. I thought I had the money, so that wasn't the issue; the real problem was deciding what to buy.For a while I debated getting a Saturn over the PlayStation. Sega had built itself quite the name at the time, and Sony was new to the market. I knew more Sega titles, like Sonic, since I had a Game Gear, but then one day at a friend's house I played a demo disc and there was a sole winter level starring this strange orange creature as the protagonist. I fell in love with it instantly, and when I discovered it was a PlayStation exclusive it was then that I declared which console to purchase.My mother and I paid a visit to our local Toys `R' Us, which was where I bought most of my Game Gear miscellany. We went to the games department and I saw the gray-silver box in all its glory. But its price wasn't so glorious to me, a child of elementary education. I was devastated when I learned I'd have to save a little more if I wanted to get the console, a game, and an extra controller in one fell sweep.That following summer, when my schooling was done and I had saved enough money, we returned to the giraffe's domain, but to my dismay the consoles no longer were available. I was defeated once again. A TRU rep informed us that the reason was because they were ridding their current stock and weren't getting more in until next week, when a fresh wave of a boxed console with an updated controller would arrive. We could come back then and check.My mother was tired of going back and forth and not finding what I wanted--I was quite the persistent whiner, after all--and goaded me into waiting till Christmas; if I did, she'd buy me an additional game.But I didn't want to wait. Santa's day was an eternity away.Next week we returned and sure enough to the TRU employee's word the new console was there. ""DUALSHOCK"" was imprinted boldly on the box in strong red colors. That meant little to me as I had no idea what that meant.I took the slip of paper that informed the cashier I was meaningful with my purchase, and went to find that game with the strange orange creature, and there it was: Crash Bandicoot 2: Cortex Strikes Back.Most of the games I played at my cousins' were co-ops, thus I thought I'd need a second controller. But the first-party Sonys were out of my price range, forcing me to settle on a 3rd-party clear controller without analog sticks. Clear stuff was all the range in the `90s, but to this day I have to get a clear controller for every system because of that initial purchase.When I got home and opened the box I realized what DualShock meant. The controller was much different than my friend's, and I quickly preferred it over other pads.This faux-review has gone on long enough, so I'll try and speed things up.I played my new console non-stop for some time, spending hours upon hours with Crash and the included demo disc in the console's box, but couldn't get very far as I didn't buy a memory card. I didn't know I'd need one, even though the TRU rep said I would. My NES didn't need one; my cousin's SNES didn't need one. But the PS did and I had to save up for that.I bought every Crash title for the PS, and spent many dollars at Blockbuster renting various titles. I grew to love Final Fantasy, Bloody Roar, Tomb Raider, Tomba, Croc, Ape Escape, Spyro, and many other fantastic series because of Sony's initial console, and have gotten every one of their consoles since.When the PS2 was released, I of course bought it and gave my old gray buddy to my kid sister, never caring to look back.Last summer that same sister bought herself a used PS2 to use as a relaxer during college, and it was then that I started developing a sharp interest in old consoles and games. I asked her about our old PS1 and she said the reason she bought a PS2 was because the PS1 had been failing but that she couldn't remember where she stored it.A month ago she texted me a picture of a sticker-covered gray machine. I picked it up the following weekend, cleaned it, and tested some titles. Unfortunately some games don't read at all, like Croc, while others, like Crash 2, work flawlessly. There's definitely some lengthier loading time than if I played the same disc in my PS3, but there's something about the lower graphical output and using the original DualShock that trumps playing the same game on the PS3.Perhaps it's nostalgia, perhaps it's empirical proof. I don't know, but all I know is that I love my PlayStation and am glad to be opening its disc tray once again. It turned me from a casual gamer into a video game connoisseur.",5
195,"This is a great and challenging game, I've wasted countless hours playing this incredible game.  I would highly recommend it to any Blizzard fan, and anyone who started the Diablo series with the 3rd installment.  Great Game.",5
196,"I remember back when I first played this and just couldn't stop. After moving and losing it I bought another copy. Not as addictive as I remember but still something if you have some time to kill.",4
197,"This game brought back so many memories, it came in the condition that was in the description. It worked perfectly.",5
198,"I really liked the original, and recently returned to the series and decided to play through the expansion; missions tend to be larger, and more resource intensive then in the original StarCraft; and very often follow a Bunker, Build, Breakout Pattern. The game definitely favors the player who masters the tech tree and knows when and how to use all there units.Unfortunately it took me very little time to realize the AI cheats, like most RTS games Brood War is (supposedly) a resource based game, but in the campaign mode the AI has unlimited resources and simply cannot be mined out.This may seem like a petty gripe, but as a resource based game, giving the AI effectively unlimited resources, seriously limits a players options (IMHO); and gives the AI a tremendous advantage; for players with excellent Micro, this is not problem, for players like me who win (when I do) economically first, its a serious handicap; and while I have not yet found a situation I simply could not win, the games often devolve into excruciating marathons; because again the AI having infinite resources can ALWAYS replace its losses; turning mission after mission into a marathon slogfests of trench warfare.While it is not uncommon in RTS games for the AI to cheat, this is supposedly done to make the game more challenging for Elite players, but no elite player will ever run into this issue because of their excellent micro skills; it is the more casual player who may not have that excellent micro who is going to run into this wall; another example of Dev's trying to please the Elites and by doing so punishing everyone else stupid enough to play their game. (Including me.)I have to admit I like the game, its engrossing, and I personally like the art and play better than SC-II which is a bit weird in its pseudo 3D for me; but I cant give a game- where the  AI is obviously cheating full points.",4
199,"Very old tech but fun for the younger set in the family.",3
200,"It's a classic. Not much else to say. I had, of course, played Star Craft before, but my CD was long lost. It was nice to get this for nostalgia's sake.",5

202,"Diablo is one of my all time favorite games, this expansion adds the Monk (and the Barbarian if you know how) and also adds the Hive and the Crypt levels and tons of stuff and spells. Also it allows you to run in town, sounds like not much but that is a big deal to me.",5

204,"the only problem i have is that it's too difficult.  i'm not sure if it's adaptive.  i'm getting clobbered.  kinda reminds me of playing chess against the computer.so after the attack is in full force, i frequently find myself turning the game off.  why am i putting myself through this?  why is getting attacked by an armada fun ?  let me go read a walkthrough ...",5
205,"A Game that is still in my library with its sequel..  Yeah I like it that much, found it addictive and imaginative as well.  It is date by today's standards and likely the online play is dead as it was when I attempted to play there.  Not to mention those out there playing online are usually hardcore and own any new people as well which was a major frustration when I finished first person a long time ago and attempted to go online haha.  This game was fun with its story and is one I consider reloading at times after so many disappointments with newer games that just don't satisfy someone who has played for so many years nor someone who wants to spend so much for so little these days.  Today's game are pretty much knock offs, level racing, mindless hack and slash, limited originality, limited character uniqueness and profit versus gamer motivated today as well.  If you want to give it a try I'd say it is worth the ten bucks..  If you really like it the sequel is good as well.  Space Command and Conquer is a good way to think of this game with a mobile mother ship for game play though it is more multi-directional that c and c..  Control might take a little to get use to but who expects a game to practically play itself lol..",4
206,"It actually fits in my pocket. The colors look great. The sound is perfect. Everything seems to be in order. The seller even threw in Match of The Millennium for free. Wow! What a great find!",5
207,"Where do I begin? I have played the first four classic entries of the series, and Lament of Innocence, the Mercury Steam Lords of Shadow and Mirror of Fate, and I must say that not only was this entry released in Konami's prime, but they have given the name Castlevania a whole new meaning while adding to the overall gameplay experience. The environment of the game is astoundingly detailed with 3D background effects, including moving objects in full 3D and the creativity involved in developing the enemies make it that much easier to immerse yourself in this wonderful complete fantasy world, and escaping reality. With that being said, seeing that this game was directly influenced by Super Metroid, and perhaps some of the other Nintendo entries to the series, I must say that the Metroid-style gameplay was executed beautifully with all kinds of different suits (or cloaks) you can pick up, fluid controls, and an absolutely fantastic soundtrack that fits each and every one of its perspective environments the tracks were made for. Another excellent aspect of this game is the idea of leveling up your character to increase stats and such. That was beautifully implemented, rewarding you with easier gameplay if you destroy enough enemies and find the most powerful cloaks and weapons you can find in the game. You can also acquire various transformations that will turn your character into either a bat, a purple wolf, or simply a handful of mist, so you can pass through obstacles that were blocked before. Overall, this game is the most groundbreaking entry of the series, and it is one that I would not mind playing again and again, as the gameplay is as versatile as it gets with these style of games.",5
208,"I've been playing through all the Castlevania games lately and none of them hold a candle to this masterpiece. Everything you want in a gothic horror, platformer is here. You will find that the RPG elements work seamlessly with the rest of the action packed gameplay.The music is amazing, with guitar riffs, classical arrangements and so much more. If that doesn't grab you, you'll be astonished by the monsters, mayhem and pacing that is found in this game. I spent hours wandering around the castle and picking up new secrets. It's really one great game.If you want that old school feeling, draw your own map, don't follow the one on the screen and make this even cooler. If you have time to burn this is your game, it's amazing.",5
209,"Before I get into anything about Quake II I have to say if you still own a Sony PlayStation or like first person shooters in general Quake II is definitely a must own! Lots of great things to say about this game...*The levels were well designed*Even today the graphics are pretty good as a 3D polygonal shooter*Love the light sourcing effects that bring realism to the overall look that Quake II has*Very smooth fluid-like gameplay and excellent use of colorThankfully the game has some pretty tough enemies because I notice with 3D shooters you don't get huge doses of enemies like you get in the older Doom games.So why 4-stars?Well (sigh) I was blown away by the first Quake and there's plenty of words for it-advanced,dark,creative,or my choice of word would be primitive. Firing a nailgun at an ogre (enemy) wielding a chainsaw and chucking grenades I thought the Quake series was just going to get more grim with every future release in it's polished form. Quake II is still a noteworthy shooter but it goes towards a hi-tech,bio-organic, cybernetic experiment and does a good job at it.It's just that the Quake series didn't stick to a particular formula.",4

216,"This game fetches for hundreds of dollars nowadays, but with that said, this is a pretty good game. You have a plot that interconnects with 108 different characters that can be recruited at their perspective times, but unless you are a completionist, you will be extremely disappointed in the ending you will get. Now, whether or not you want to spend $100 on this is entirely up to you. I spent it, and I felt I somewhat got my money's worth, but at the same time, a little disappointed that I spent this much on a game, but oh well, there is worse, like $400 for Panzer Dragoon Saga. Anyways, just like with any other Suikoden entry, you can go to war with the kingdom whom the main character is opposing with, and use all kinds of tactics in battle that will determine your fate. The story is pretty solid, and the character development is also quite solid as well, and you have a lot of lush, beautiful environments to traverse through, with a world map. Overall, this game is good, but be prepared to drop a fraction of your wallet if you want this.",4
217,"Ah yes, the legendary Metal Gear Solid series. It was originally a classic on the MSX2 computer in Japan, but the series became really good when it debuted on the PlayStation. Developed and published by Konami with Hideo Kojima being the director and producer, this was the first game in the series to become very popular. The games ground breaking graphics, addicting gameplay, challenging stealth action and its amazing storyline heavily influenced games that would later produce well detailed story lines. It was originally released on PlayStation, but would be re-released on the PlayStation Store as a PS One Classic, a remake on the GameCube and there was even a port on Game Boy Color which apparently got good reviews (I find that hard to believe, I&#8217;ll have to check that out some day).The storyline is the most complex and most detailed of any video game that was released at that point. There are tons of cut scenes, character dialogues and we didn&#8217;t see a game like this back then. The story takes place in 2005, about six years after the events of Metal Gear 2: Solid Snake and 10 years after the events of the first Metal Gear. A genetically enhanced Special Forces unit called FOXHOUND has invaded a nuclear weapons disposal facility on Shadow Moses island in Alaska&#8217;s Fox Archipelago. The forces demand that the U.S. government turn over the remains of Big Boss within 24 hours or they will launch a nuclear weapon. Big Boss was the main antagonist in the first two Metal Gear games who is one of the greatest soldiers who ever lived. The terrorists want the body so they can take his genes and put them inside the soldiers so they can become an army of super soldiers and take over the world. The main hero Solid Snake is forced out of retirement and is sent to go to the island and stop the threat. I won&#8217;t say anything else about the story because my reviews are always spoiler free, you have to play the game to see it for yourself.Like with Super Mario 64 and The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time on Nintendo 64, Metal Gear Solid was making a leap into the third dimension and the graphics for their time were very well detailed and the game has aged pretty well. Details such as seeing the characters breath in the cold, very high draw distance, seeing smoke from cigarettes or footprints in the snow is all in this game. The gameplay is very similar to the 2D Metal Gear games on the MSX2 computer. The game is all about sneaking by without detection rather than a straight on shooter, but there are moments where you do go in all guns blazing, but it&#8217;s mostly a sneaking mission because going in guns blazing makes the game much harder. I like stealth games like this because it makes us cautious and can even be scary at times because everything is quiet and suddenly a security camera or guard spots you, the alarm goes off and you&#8217;re slightly startled and have to hide and hope they don&#8217;t find you.The most innovative feature in the game is the radar which shows the terrain and your enemy&#8217;s field of vision. It&#8217;s very useful and you&#8217;ll see yourself looking at it all the time. But in some areas, the radar gets jammed and you won&#8217;t be able to use the radar if you are spotted so you shouldn&#8217;t get too used to it. Ways to get by undetected include crawling under objects, hiding in boxes, hiding behind walls and making noise to distract the enemy. The game also includes many gadgets and items such as infra-red goggles, night vision goggles, mine detectors, rations, binoculars, the famous cardboard box and&#8230;cigarettes?The weapons include hand to hand, you can choke your enemies to death, use a standard pistol with a silencer, grenades, C4, machine gun, proximity mines, a remote controlled missile launcher, a sniper rifle and even a Stinger missile launcher which uses heat seekers to follow your target.The boss battles are very epic and every one of them has a strategy to defeat and it&#8217;s always best to use your radio to contact your support crew for tips on how to defeat them. The radio is also used to provide info about the games back story and even the controls.The game also features a training mode called VR Mode where you can practice hiding techniques, weapon use and sneaking. This is one of the best games on the original PlayStation and the only flaw I see with this game is that you can&#8217;t aim in first person view mode which can make it difficult to shoot some of the enemies. But other than that, the game is practically flawless, it has great graphics, is challenging and one of the most detailed story lines of all time. It is simply a masterpiece and a must play for any kind of gamer.FINAL RATING: 10 out of 10",5
218,"This game was way ahead of its time.",4
219,"Until now I've never played a lot of the PS1 classics. I can safely say though, that this game is awesome. No matter how many times I accidentally walk into a surveillance camera, I still have a lot of fun sneaking around and hiding.",5
220,"Hideo Kojima's ""Metal Gear Solid"" (1998) is like a great classic film that has now become required viewing for movie buffs - this is required playing for gaming enthusiasts. It stars Solid Snake, a weary, gruff veteran of the battlefield with a deep, gravelly voice, who always keeps a pack of cigarettes handy just in case. His mission is to infiltrate a nuclear weapons facility on an island off the coast of Alaska, code-named ""Shadow Moses,"" which is currently being occupied by the ex-black ops unit turned terrorist group known as ""Foxhound."" It's not immediately apparent what the group's ultimate goal is, and in fact one of the great pleasures of ""MGS"" is the way in which the story slowly unravels. Many of the characters have secrets and motivations of their own, some of which wisely go unexplained (what's Ocelot really up to?). As a game made on PS1 hardware, the gameplay holds up considerably well for its time. It's played from a third-person top-down perspective. You can equip different gear (rations, binoculars) on the lower left of the screen and weapons (guns, explosives) on the lower right. Stealth plays a big role as you constantly try to avoid alerting the patrolling guards. The best gameplay sequences involve the unique boss battles with the members of ""Foxhound."" These sections are fun because no boss or battle is alike, and each character that you duel feels wholly original. The main draw and what makes this game, and the series, so special is the masterful storytelling that grabs ahold of you and doesn't let go. It's the stellar voice cast, including David Hayter as Snake, the ingenious plot, the phenomenal soundtrack and atmosphere - it's the meticulously crafted world that you can't help being completely absorbed in.--- 5 STARS ---",5

The only thing I can say is that you will have a hard time playing this if you do not have a playstation controller with an analog stick. The controls are EXTREMELY difficult.

228,"Daikatana was reviled by virtually everybody back in the day.  That's why I never got around to playing it, until now.  People hated the save gems, hated maneuvering the sidekicks, and hated the performance glitches.  Things have changed since then.  Currently this game can be downloaded from GOG.com for $5.99 and often goes on sale.  I paid $2.99 for it.  I suggest bypassing the discs and getting it from that site.  That version runs perfectly on today's computers and has an option to allow for unlimited saves, which is what we all want.  As far as the sidekicks-yes they can be a headache at times.  There are times when you'll have to control not one but two sidekicks.(Who thought this was a good idea?).  But not always and once you get the hang of it it isn't too bad.  More often than not you'll just command your sidekicks to remain behind while you clear out an area rather then have them die fighting alongside you.  Because if a sidekick dies it's time to hit F3 and reload a save point.  Not a problem, just remember to save often.  The game-play is fun though.  I found the levels interesting and at times the game reminded me of the first Half-Life and Quake 2.  It's an old game so the graphics are on par with those two.  There are a bunch of secret areas to find also which is always fun.  Cool weapons and lots of creatures to kill as well so what's not to like?",4

The in-game camera is quite poor, making it hard to see where you're going at times, and the sound effects for the game are frequently annoying, and overly repetitive.Maybe I liked this as a kid, but after a number of years this game definitely does not hold up.",3

236,"Simply put, this is the very best 8-button fighting game controller for the Dreamcast that money can buy.Every serious Dreamcast owner should have one.Had one for like 10 years and it still works great even today.These things are built to last, and can take TONS of abuse.Slam it, bash it, mash it, whatever...The large oversized contoured design fits comfortably in adult-sized hands, and the rubberized anti-slip pads ensure that this controller doesn't slip around at all during the most intense gaming moments.The D-pad and buttons are all very accurate and responsive, and that's what really matters the most for fighting games, ya know.This awesome controller will allow you to bust out ANY special moves in your favorite fighting games with ease and flow.Scoring massive 30-hit chain combos (absolutely brutal and cheap) on Capcom vs SNK 2 are no problem with this controller!",5
237,"In Omega Boost, you control a mech in space with fully rotational dynamics making for fun gameplay. The D-pad and buttons make the controls in this game comfortable and a breeze. The opening movie sequence is also classic so take a look at that as it might sell you on how awesome the game is.This game itself is hard as nails and it doesn't save on a PS2 memory card so keep that in mind. There's two bosses on every level from what I could tell and I couldn't get past the 3rd level. I returned it because the seller listed it as new and forgot to include the box and artwork leading me to reconsider the purchase. I would buy Omega Boost again for a decent price because it is fun but I'll probably be trying other new games out before I retry this one.",4
238,"quake 2 is one of the if not the best 3d fps games i have ever played first of the level is detailed and superb reminding me of the first half of doom it realy does seem like an industrial planet of machine people the music is downright awesome really fitting for the kind of gameplay quake 2 has all of the guns are powerful and balanced my personal favorites is the railgun and super shotgun and the enemies are all great looking and original, there isnt much of a story, but honestly it would probably just get in the way. Probably the only things I dont like, is there is WAY to much ammo in this game the boss fights are rather easy, and even on the highest difficulty i played through the entire game and probably died less than 10 times. Mainly the game is just to easy but with that said this game is fantastic and i would recomend it to anyone for just being really fun, easy to get into and being a memorable fps.  9.6/10",5

242,"I know everyone is entitled to their own opinions, but for this sort of game, bad opinions are rendered useless! This game is underrated for the wrong reasons (sadly FF9 is too). You'll find that most people who hate FF8 like FF7. This is not true for all but from what I have seen, most. And some of them can't even get the damn character's name right or played the whole game through, but still giving a review. I have heard this is a romance game. Actually, FF10 was the most romantic one. Play it over if you don't believe me. I have beat FF7 including all the other boring milked parts. I can honestly say, ""IT WAS NOT AS HALF AS GOOD AS 8!!!"" Don't get wrong, FF7 was great but as I easily breezed through it on first try without training, I realized that it was no challenge. The storyline didn't have me screaming for more (just being honest). After everything I heard about FF7, I had my hopes up high. They were dropped when I discovered that there was nothing special about this game when I already beat FF8. And still I am waiting for a Final Fantasy that can match this one. The only thing keeping my interest in FF7 was Sephiroth and Vincent. Vincent actually was the only lead character I played with when discovering him in Sephiroth's mansion after he set it aflame. Oh and this was when Cloud was loosing himself. So we not only lost him but Tifa for a short while too. I could give so many reasons why FF8 is one of the best RPGs out there but of course there will always be someone you can't please.Final Fantasy 8 was nothing short of amazing even in the credits. The overture was already a mind blowing number from Nobuo Uematsu. The picture quality like FF7 at the time was breathtaking. So as you start a new game, you are already thrown into another beautiful musical score under the theme of Sorceress Edea. You then see several flashes and a fight between Seifer and Squall. So this intro already had my attention. After the opening ends, Squall is in the infirmary and the game pretty much goes from there. I am not going to give a walkthrough, but in storyline the game really went above and beyond. This is the reason why they call Final Fantasy, Final Fantasy. We see progression in Squall who pretty much could be a rival of Cloud, and also the other characters in the game. From the ballroom dance, Dollet landing, the missions, sorceress/ possessions to the space scenes, the developing intimacy between characters, and the final boss battles, I can play this game over and over. Storyline 10/10.The gameplay seems to strike an irritating nerve with some gamers. First I must say I have seen worse FF battle systems. Actually you get to take a break from needing to have MP (Elixirs whatnot) or upgrading materia and just stock magic. This only becomes a problem if you stock every freaken magic you see. Only stock the well worth magic. Your level must be high enough to get certain types so train well or if you are an expert, use other means. However, the atb system is active so you must move quickly. I love the almost 1min cinematic moves which reminds me a lot of Legend of Dragoon. This Final Fantasy mixes that and then takes music and fighting to a whole new scale. You know if the music changes or slows down, the boss is going to be a problem (Omega, Adel, Griever, Ultimecia etc.). Also guys, the junction is easy as hell to learn. It was so easy to put together that I learned it within a few minutes after buy. These are not valid reasons to throw the game under the bus. Final Fantasy gameplay shouldn't be so repetitive. But to continue, like all FF parts, we get to see some of the same summoning's and powerful magic on the field. Gameplay 10/10.I am not going into the music seeing as I already have. I'll just say the whole soundtrack is worth downloading from ITunes. Excellent! Perfect! 10/10The characters are what make FF parts fun. FF8 has a grand scale of well developed characters. Even the not so talked about characters like Ward, Laguna, and Kiros were awesome! Laguna's theme along with almost the entire soundtrack is memorable. As the main characters progress, we get to keep track of Squall's uncle and his events regarding Ellone. You get to play with a conceded sniper Irvine and Zell the punching and kicking machine. The women on this FF game are actually worth playing and not so delicate as Aerith from FF7. Selphie and Rinoa can be very suprising with their inner strengths. Have you ever came across ""The End?"" I kid you not, I used this on Soceress Adel many times and it worked! With Ultimecia, using Rinoa is awesome because her dog Angelo can be strong. And lets not forget the gunblade specialist Squall whose attacks are never short of amazing. I am not a fan of Quistis but if you like her she can get her specials from random items. Overall 10/10PS: It is up to you if you are going to believe all the lies about FF8. I actually find that the games most people praise a lot are not the ones worth buying. Not to go off topic but games like Silent Hill, Resident Evil, and Fear may be considered the best horror games. But really games like Fatal Frame, Haunting Ground, The Calling, Rule of the Rose, Kuon, Koudelka, etc are 10 times better in storyline or scarier.",5

244,"FF VIII is hated because it is not FF VII. It offers amazing gameplay, huge sidequests, great graphics, a cast of interesting deep intertwined characters and alot of optional material. All the different summons (Guardian Forces) and the abilites they come with alone makes the game thrilling. A must play for any RPG games concerned with plots and side quests. Also you can get Odin as a&#34;summon&#34;. I put it that way because once you get him he will randomly appear and kill every enemy.",5

247,"There are many versions of Rayman 2 out there, ranging from the N64 to the Playstation 2. Each version has small variations in graphics, sound quality, and controls, but they are all in essence the same game, and what a game it is.Rayman 2: The Great Escape is the sequel to the Playstation exclusive Rayman. In this adventure, Rayman has been captured by an army of robotic pirates who are conquering the world. After a narrow escape, Rayman is charged with finding an all powerful being named Polkus who can stop the pirates' conquest. Now it is once again up to Rayman to rescue the captured people and save the world.The biggest change is the transition from 2D to 3D gameplay. The game is a third person platformer with simple and tight controls. Rayman can use his hair as a chopper propeller to glide down rather than fall which can be a life saving move. The combat is very well implemented. By pressing the left trigger the camera centers behind Rayman and if an enemy is present you will lock on to them. Rayman attacks by shooting energy from his hand, which is upgraded over the course of the game. Part of the game if collecting the 1000 yellow Lums scattered across each level. Finding these Lums allows you to access the later levels and unlocks entries in an in game log that expands on the game's backstory. Some of the Lums are found in cages which are also littered throughout the game, 80 in total. For every ten cages your health bar is extended. Finding all the Lums and cages in any given level grants a bonus game where you can win attack upgrades though they are only temporary. The game has great flow that makes each level very fun to play through.As stated before, Rayman 2 was ported to may consoles. Although it was originally released on the N64, a good version in it's own right, it was later re-released to the PC which started the long line of ports and remakes. The Dreamcast version is the closest to the PC version in terms of graphics and sound quality. It also upped the framerate to a smooth 60 FPS. Although the Playstation version is largely the same and contains a hidden tech demo of the original Rayman 2 Beta, the PS version suffers long load times and a severe drop in graphical quality. The Playstation 2 had the game Rayman 2: Revolution which is an extreme overhaul of the original game. I personally believe that version is different enough from the rest to be owned in addition to the original game which, of the many versions, the Dreamcast version offers the highest quality.",5

255,"After years of coveting my friends Super Nintendo, I finally got my first gaming console. In the Christmas of 1996, the Nintendo 64 arrived.The Nintendo 64, or N64 as it is sometimes referred, followed in the wake of success of the first Sony console, the PlayStation, and started producing their games with 3D graphics. Instead of limiting the player to only being able to move forward and backward, or left and right, you could now move in all directions. This opened a portal for Nintendo to take some of their classic characters and put them in truly immersive worlds. For example, Mario was no longer a 16-bit side scrolling red and blue pixel, but a small Italian man with a healthy knack for adventure. Being able to see these characters up close and all around was something like we had never seen before. The result ended up being games like Super Mario 64, Star Fox 64, The Legend of Zelda Ocarina of Time and the countless hours and vivid gameplay that they would offer.With a very simple design and set up like the previous 2 Nintendo consoles (SNES & NES) the 64 was another cartridge based Nintendo console with no load times and generally easy maintenance (remember blowing into the cartridges and consoles?). The controller however, was something that was dramatically different from both previous Nintendo consoles. This controller offered an analog stick and more than the standard 2 or 4 buttons. The analog stick was great for the 3D games and made it very easy to navigate, however, after enough hours of play it stop working in one way or another.It's interesting to see how Nintendo has come full circle, evolving to something like the Nintendo 64 and in some ways digressing back to it's origins with games like New Super Mario Bros U, which is much like Super Mario Bros for SNES but with updated graphics and a few more tweaks.",4

You also can't build up a hunting party and people you meet have no real purpose because you can go anywhere. I never figured out the importance of any of the story line.",2

264,"It all started with this game, ""Medal Of Honor,"" released exclusively for the original Playstation all the way back in 1999.  It's no surprise at all that this game was inspired by the Steven Spielburg movie ""Saving Private Ryan,"" given that it was developed by the in-house video game department of Dreamworks Studios and published by Electronic Arts.  Granted, it definitely looks old and outdated, and the moves you can actually perform in the game are extremely limited, but it's still remarkable in some areas and remains the launching point for one of the biggest WWII video game franchises of all time.  Also, it's never to be confused at all with the 2010 modern warfare version of the same name, which I'll refer to as ""MOH 2010.""Medal Of Honor is strongly geared towards the ""run-n-gun"" style of FPS gameplay that was extremely popular at the time.  This is driven home by the fact that you can't zoom in at all with any weapon, the sole exception being the sniper rifle, when you hit the aim button.  You just get a crosshair that shows you exactly where the bullet will hit.  You also are unable to move while aiming, instead only being allowed to lean left or right.  All of this means that you're better off just charging the enemy with an automatic weapon that has a sizeable ammo clip instead of trying to pick them off from afar.  If you do manage to acquire a sniper rifle, you'll actually be able to manually zoom in a great deal, and is extremely helpful for picking off far away soldiers or those manning stationary heavy machine guns or rocket launchers.  A major aspect that's perhaps the most unforgiving is the lack of a checkpoint system.  This means you have to finish the entire level or section in one try.  If you die or quit, you have to attempt it all over again from the beginning.The enemy AI was actually quite impressive for the time it was released.  They'll go prone to reduce their exposure, utilize cover effectively, make use of savage German Shepards to rip you a new hole, and actually throw back grenades you send their way.  Also, just like every other early game before the 2000s, you have to find healthpacks to replenish your health, and on the hardest difficulty, the Nazis can drain your health pretty quickly.  There are some stealth sections of the game that disguise you as a Nazi soldier with false papers and a silenced pistol.  It quickly becomes apparent that the enemies are extremely deaf, as an unsilenced weapon won't alert another soldier who's farther away.  It's very funny when you show a soldier your false papers, then nail them in the head as they walk away.The graphics are extremely primitive, poor, and limited, but this was the PS1, one of the first console systems to utilize CDs instead of cartridges.  Most of the game takes place at night time, and the draw distance is laughable.  The landscape magically materializes into view as you move through it, and the overall graphics are muddy, blurry, and static.  The sound, on the other hand, is absolutely fantastic.  Weapons sound loud, clear, and distinct, and environmental ambience is wonderfully utilized to slightly offset the awful graphics.""Medal Of Honor 1999"" is without a doubt lacking in all areas when compared to later entries, and even other WWII titles.  However, it is still good for what it is: a run-n-gun WWII FPS that offers a suitable challenge, surprisingly adept enemies, amazing sound design, and a healthy heaping of nostalgia.  If nothing else, MOH 1999 should be remembered as the game that launched one of the biggest WWII video game franchises of all time.",5

I'm sure it's not the worst Mario game out there, but it's the worst one I've played. It's not a horrible game, but it's just not as good as its predecessors or its successors. The biggest complaint I have are the controls and the physics. It doesn't even feel like a Mario game. The controls are klunky and often unresponsive, the physics are weird, like the Fire Flower's Fireball. It ricochets everywhere before eventually going out. The enemies are unlike anything I've ever seen in Mario. In one world, you have to Easter Island Heads with arms and legs, kinda like Nosepass from Pokemon. The Koopas explode when you jump on them. I don't mean they explode and die, i mean, when you jump on them, they go into their shell, and explode like a Bob-Omb, hurting you if you're too close. The graphics, I can't give TOO much flack to because it IS gameboy, but it doesn't look much better than the Mario Calculator games I played back in highschool. I'd say skip this one, go straight to Mario 2. It's much MUCH better.",2

274,"Years before Michael Bay's would-be catastrophe came along, turtles ruled the world.  They ran all the industries that mattered; comics, TV, movies and games, like this one.Based on the 90's cartoon show, the objective of this Game Boy title is simple: Rescue April O'Neil from the Foot Clan using one of the four Turtles.  With 3 basic attacks at your disposal, you fight your way through 5 level filled with ninjas, robots and floating boxes of pizza to replenish your health.  Though enough grunts are thrown in to increase the challenge, you can beat the end bosses wearing your ninja mask backwards.  On the off-chance you do use up our heroes, the game ends.Besides changing the limited control scheme to one's own taste, the player also has the option to choose whichever stage he wants.  So you can either play through the whole thing and get the full cowabunga experience, or skip all the way to the end for near-instant gratification.  Kinda defeats the purpose, doesn't it?Like any 9-year-old, I was obsessed with owning a copy while I could still go out and buy one.  Now that I've tried it after seeing the best that 21st-century gaming has to offer, Mom's cooking doesn't taste as good anymore.This game is unrated.",3

280,"Aladdin is one of the best-selling Genesis games of all time. Unlike most games that undeservedly sell ludicrous amounts of copied (I'm looking at you, Call of Duty), Aladdin actually deserves this distinction. It's a definitive masterpiece of a platform game, and everything included in its design was implemented to create one of the funnest games on the console.First things first, and probably what you'll initially notice when starting the game, is that the visuals here are outstanding, especially for the time, and it still holds up surprisingly well today. Aladdin (the game, not the character) looks as though you're playing the movie on your console. It really is that good. The color palette is constantly, unabashedly appealing, the character sprites are large, and much like the backgrounds, extensively detailed, and the enemies are all interesting and distinctive due to their aesthetic visual designs. The game looking as good as it does is in no small part to actual Disney animators that worked on the film this is based on animating the in-game sprites. This is the very first game to use this style of animation, and boy, does it show. Character movements are outstandingly fluid, small background animations fare just as well, and all-in-all, this is truly one of the best looking Genesis games you can get your hands on. Vectorman? Who's Vectorman?Now, the sheer beauty of the visuals wouldn't mean anything if there weren't a solid game backing them up. Thankfully, there absolutely is. Gameplay-wise, Aladdin can be best described as a platformer. However, it takes more than enough deviations from the established tropes of the genre to craft a memorable experience. Instead of jumping on enemies to dispatch of them, Aladdin wields a sword to slice his enemies to bits (ok, it's not THAT graphic. This is Disney, after all), or throws apples at foes, which he collects throughout the levels. Personally, I prefer the swordplay here. I mean, who wouldn't? The apples definitely have their uses, though, and become absolutely indispensable for some of the boss fights.The other main deviation the game takes from the platformer genre is in its level design. Through the use of foreground and background objects, Aladdin can search behind (or in front) of these to discover 1-ups, health pickups, gems (which are used to buy more 1-ups and continues), or more apples. This works exceedingly well, considering it adds depth, not only to the visuals, but to the actual level design and overarching gameplay. I consider this aspect (much like many other aspects of Aladdin) absolutely revolutionary for its time. This was the very first Genesis game I played, and at the time, I was so used to games that didn't have any visual depth to them, that this idea of searching behind background objects absolutely blew my mind. Like I said, it's still impressive to this day. I still think it's absolutely revolutionary.The level design, aside from the visuals and awesome swordplay, is probably the best thing about this game. It's hard to say, as so much of this game comes off as pure 16-bit gold. The levels here never overstay their welcome, and the game moves at a brisk pace. Generally, levels can take 3-5 minutes to complete if you're rushing through them, but thankfully, you'll have so much fun exploring these levels, looking for that last 1-up or partial health refill, that you can extend this time. Despite doing this, the game never, once feels as though it's dragging on. The pace feels impressively natural to the gameplay, and the levels, and visuals that accompany them, enforce this sentiment. You'll be running around the streets of Agrabah, traversing the desert, exploring dark, dank dungeons, escaping a lava avalanche (lava-lanche?) just to name a few, and these all feel appropriate from a game design perspective. Traversing the dungeon feels more like a maze level, with its branching paths and freedom of player-choice, and the escape from the lava-lanche (see? It works) is exhilirating. It's a sweaty hand, controller squeezing, heart racing experience, and it's easily the most exciting level in the game. The scrolling here is so fast, the lava looks as though you can see the heat coming right off of it, and all-in-all, every level may not be as impressive as this one, but they're certainly close. I can't stress enough how amazing these stages are.The audio here is just as outstanding as any other aspect in this game. I'd go as far to say that this is one of the best sounding games on Genesis. From the clear melodies, full bass tones, and near-perfect approximations of the music score, this is easily one of the most memorable soundtracks in all of gaming. Even the original songs stand out in the sense that they don't stand out. They feel right at home. You could have told me that these original tracks were taken straight from the film and then composed and converted to the Genesis FM Synth hardware, and I would have absolutely believed you. They actually hold their own in comparison to Disney songs. They truly are that great. The sound effects fare just as well. The voice samples are outstanding, and even put some voice samples I've heard on the SNES to shame (which, for the record, honestly isn't as surprising as you would initially think. Voice samples in Genesis games can sound absolutely superior to SNES games, if placed in the right hands).The control is nice and responsive, though the jumping physics may take a bit of time to get used to. From a stand-still, Aladdin doesn't jump nearly as far as he would from running. It's also worth noting that when changing your direction from left to right, the screen will snap to adjust to Aladdin's direction. Considering this is a Dave Perry/Doug TenNappel designed game, these aspects are almost expected  For those that are used to games like Earthworm Jim, it's not a problem. However, those that are expecting a game that controls like Super Mario World, stop it, and accept these controls for what they are. Objectively speaking, there's nothing wrong with them, and they absolutely are tight. Nothing here feels slippery, at all, and jumping, though a shallow learning curve is there, is absolutely spot-on and feels great once you know how to do it.Bonus stages are also here. There are two main bonus levels, one being a small, slot machine type game you play to earn extra lives, apples, gems and the like, and the other are stages where you get to play as Abu; Aladdin's pet monkey. The great thing about the Abu stages is that they're based on precise character placement, jumping, sword slashing (yes, even the cute monkey has a sword - awesome!), and collecting various items. These stages work well, in the sense that they enforce how tight the control really is in this game, and the animation on Abu, much like every single character in the game, is seriously astounding. For my money, this is one of the single best animated games of its generation, coming in at a close third to Earthworm Jim 1 & 2.I sincerely can't stress enough how enthralling this game is to play, as well as to look at. It really is beautiful from a visual aesthetic and technical design standpoint, and there really aren't too many games that matched its level of overall quality. This game is an all-time classic with good reason. It's one of the best games from its generation, it has that &#34;just right&#34; difficulty that many of its peers seem to be missing, and overall, you'd be doing yourself a disservice by passing it up. It's relatively cheap, and considering the quality of this game, it's an absolute steal. Buy this game, right now. There's no way you'll be disappointed with it.",5
281,"Batman forever was a game that wasn't even worth spending money on buying it those pour kids parents paid 50 bucks when it just came out and when they took it home to play it i bet you they said they spent all that money and it sucked this game was worse then Atari 2600s E.T. and that was the worst game ever made so you ever gave this game 5 stars i mean i like mortal kombat to but this game should be thrown in the trash with all the other garbage because it gave batman a bad reputation",1

290,"This is one of the best games for the 64 and it sells for a fair price.  We all know Rare made some of the best games on the system and this was no exception.  To sum up the plot you are a driver is a set of various construction / destruction vehicles tasked with clearing the way for nuclear missiles.  If you don't clear the level the rockets go boom.As simple as the plot is the game play is as well.  It's as simple as driving and using a few cool moves and special weapons.  There are some basic puzzles at times along the way that challenge you to think ahead.Where the game really excels in my opinion is how you choose to way to end the game.  You can end at getting the weapons to their final place and launch the space shuttle, or you can go and get all the collectibles and open planetary travel.  Going through the planet levels is fun and trying to earn all gold medals and then platinum is very challenging and will really up your skills.Buy this game and have hours of fun!",5
291,"While modern games often get boring and feel exactly the same throughout the entire game, donkey kong always has something new around the corner. Its so fun to go explore. While its a tiny bit dated it was ahead of its time. This game showed the the N64 was capable of. Too bad microsoft ruined the chances of us getting another donkey kong like this. Imagine what they could do if they did something similar on the Wii U and put in as much effort into that game.",5

294,"Collectibles, collectibles, collectibles. This game is all about collecting stuff. It's very different from past Donkey Kong games. No more are the pleasant side-scrolling levels of DK Island. This game almost feels like it should have been a Banjo-Kazooie game. A solid platformer with a killer introduction rap song keeps this game out of the fire.Fun Fact: Grant Kirkhope (the composer of Donkey Kong 64) provided the voice for Donkey Kong in this game.",5

299,"Nostalgia! This was the first game I ever played and I remember beating it....getting the black and white Yoshis and all the levels done etc but now that I come back to it (10+ years later) it's a lot harder than I remember. I still like it though, even if it's childish and simplistic I just can't help but enjoy myself playing it.... the art and combined music kinda makes me just...happy. I know it's not a favorite for everyone or even enjoyable for everyone and I am a bit biased because of my past but oh well. It's a cute game, if you have kids it would be very suitable for an introduction into the gaming world. It was mine~",5
