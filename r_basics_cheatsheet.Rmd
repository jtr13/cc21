# Basics R Cheatsheet

Wanxiao Hong

This is an PDF version cheat sheet for basic R functions, such as data read/write, libraries, math functions. I personally find that for R beginners who are familiar with other programming languages, the most basic functions and attributes are the most un-intuitive part. And these
basic information are often scattered in different webs. Searching every single time is inconvenient. So I make this cheat sheet for quicker look up.
