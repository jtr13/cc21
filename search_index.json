[["index.html", "Spring 2021 EDAV Community Contributions Chapter 1 Community contribution assignment 1.1 Logistics", " Spring 2021 EDAV Community Contributions 2021-03-17 Chapter 1 Community contribution assignment This fairly open-ended assignment provides an opportunity to receive credit for contributing to the collective learning of the class, and perhaps beyond. It should reflect a minimum of 2-3 hours of work. To complete the assignment you must submit a short description of your contribution. If appropriate, attach relevant files. There are many ways in which you can contribute: lead a Zoom conversation on anything: hobby, happy hour, etc. Think about how you will organize it… do students need to sign up? Will you have breakout rooms? help students find final project partners give a well-rehearsed 5 minute lightning talk in class on a datavis topic (theory or tool) (email me to set the date – it may be after the assignment due date but you need to schedule it before) create a video tutorial (any length) create a cheatsheet or other resource be a Piazza super user (that is, answer a lot of questions) write a tutorial for a tool that’s not well documented translate a useful resource into another language build a viz product (ex. htmlwidget) for class use create a web site for sharing class resources publicly provide significant subject matter help to a classmate organize and lead a help session on a particular topic (the date may be after the assignment due date but you need to schedule it before) [your own idea] You may draw on and expand existing resources. When doing so, it is critical that you cite your sources. Examples from last year: https://jtr13.github.io/cc20/ 1.1 Logistics 1.1.1 Groups You may work on your own or with a partner of your choosing. If you work alone, you do not need to join a group of 1, you simply submit your work on CourseWorks as with any other solo assignment. If you work with a partner, add yourselves to a group on the CC page on the People tab. Piazza can be used to find partners with similar interests. 1.1.2 Submitting your assignment You must submit your assignment twice: once on CourseWorks (so it can be graded) and once to the class, details to follow. CourseWorks submission: submit your work as an .Rmd and rendered .pdf or .html file, just as with problem sets. If your work does not lend itself to that format, then write in the assignment text box what you did. Class (GitHub) submission: see the next chapter. "],["github-submission-instructions.html", "Chapter 2 GitHub submission instructions 2.1 Background 2.2 Preparing your .Rmd file 2.3 Submission steps 2.4 Optional tweaks 2.5 FAQ", " Chapter 2 GitHub submission instructions This chapter gives you all the information you need to upload your community contribution. Please read this entire document carefully before making your submission. Of particular note is the fact that bookdown requires a different .Rmd format than you’re used to, so you must make changes to the beginning of the file as described below before submitting. 2.1 Background This web site makes use of the bookdown package to render a collection of .Rmd files into a nicely formatted online book with chapters and subchapters. Your job will be to submit a slightly modified version of your community contribution .Rmd file to the GitHub repository where the source files for this web site are stored. On the backend, the admins will divide the chapters into book sections and order them. If your community contribution is in a different format, then create a short .Rmd file that explains what you did, and includes links to any relevant files, such as slides, etc. which you can post on your GitHub repo (or another online site.) 2.2 Preparing your .Rmd file You should only submit ONE Rmd file. After completing these modifications, your .Rmd should look like this sample .Rmd. Create a concise, descriptive name for your project. For instance, name it base_r_ggplot_graph or something similar if your work is about contrasting/working with base R graphics and ggplot2 graphics. Check the .Rmd filenames in the project repo to make sure your name isn’t already taken. Your project name should be words only and joined with underscores, no white space. Use .Rmd not .rmd. In addition, all letters must be lowercase. Create a copy of your .Rmd file with the new name. Completely delete the YAML header (the section at the top of the .Rmd that includes name, title, date, output, etc.) including the --- line. Choose a short, descriptive, human readable title for your project as your title will show up in the table of contents – look at examples in the 2020 EDAV rendered book of community contributions https://jtr13.github.io/cc20. Capitalize the first letter only (“sentence case”). On the first line of your document, enter a single hashtag, followed by a single whitespace, and then your title. It is important to follow this format so that bookdown renders your title as a header. Do not use single # headers anywhere else in the document. Note: if your chapter is the first in a section, a second # header and section description will be requested during the pull-request and merge phase. The second line should be blank, followed by your name(s): # Base R vs. ggplot2 Aaron Burr and Alexander Hamilton Your content starts here. If your project requires data, please use a built-in dataset or read directly from a URL, such as: df &lt;- readr::read_csv(\"https://people.sc.fsu.edu/~jburkardt/data/csv/addresses.csv\") If you absolutely must include a data file, please use a small one, as for many reasons it is desirable to keep the repository size as small as possible. If you have included a setup chunk in your Rmd file, please remember to remove the label setup in the chunk, i.e., use: {r, include=FALSE} instead of: {r setup, include=FALSE} If your project requires libraries to be installed and included in the document, please adhere to the following conventions. Do not evaluate any install.packages() statements in your document. Consumers of an .Rmd file won’t want packages to get installed when they knit your document. Include any library() statements at the top of your Rmd file, below the title, name, and setup, but above any content. If your chapter requires the installation of a package from source (is a GitHub installation), please add a comment identifying it as such. Please mention this as well in your PR. Here is an example library() section with install statements that won’t be evaluated: install.packages(&quot;devtools&quot;) # used for installation from source install.packages(&quot;dplyr&quot;) install.packages(&quot;ggplot2&quot;) library(&quot;devtools&quot;) devtools::install_github(&quot;twitter/AnomalyDetection&quot;) library(&quot;AnomalyDetection&quot;) # must be installed from source library(&quot;dplyr&quot;) library(&quot;ggplot2&quot;) You could include both sections, or you could just include the second library() section and trust R users to install any packages themselves. If you developed your Rmd file before moving your library() statements above the rest of the file content, it is highly recommended to knit and review your document again. This may change the namespace that was available in each section of your code during development, causing a function not to work or to exhibit unexpected behavior. This common issue is mentioned in the EDAV R Basics “Functions stop working” section. Your file should not contain getwd() / setwd() calls (you should never use these in scripts anyway!) nor write statements. Want to get fancy? See the optional tweaks section below. 2.3 Submission steps To submit your work, we will be following “Workflow #4” – that is submitting a pull request to someone else’s repository to which you do not have write access. Instructions are available in this tutorial. They are repeated below in abbreviated form, with specific instructions on naming conventions, content information, and other important details. Fork cc21 repo (this repo) to your GitHub account. Clone/download the forked repo to your local computer. Create a new branch and name it with your project name, in our case sample_project. Do not skip this step. We will not merge your PR if it doesn’t come from a branch. If you already forgot to do this, check this tutorial for how to fix it. Copy your modified .Rmd file with the same name into the root directory on the branch. In our example, it is sample_project.Rmd. Do not include an .html file. (In order for the bookdown package to work, all .Rmd files will be rendered behind the scenes.) [OPTIONAL] If you have other resources (such as images) included in your project, create a folder under resources/. In our example, it is resources/sample_project/. Put the resources files there. Be sure to change all the links in your .Rmd to include resources/.../, for example: ![Test Photo](resources/sample_project/election.jpg) When you are ready to submit your project, push your branch to your remote repo. Follow this tutorial to create a pull request. At this point a back and forth will begin with the team managing the pull requests. If you are asked to make changes, simply make the changes on your local branch, save, commit, and push to GitHub. The new commits will be added to your pull request; you do not need to, and should not, create a new pull request. (If, based on the circumstances, it does make sense to close the pull request and start a new one, we will tell you.) Once your pull request is merged, it’s fine to delete your local clone (folder) as well as the forked repository in your GitHub account. 2.4 Optional tweaks If you prefer for links from your chapter to open in new tabs, add {target=\"_blank\"} after the link, such as: [edav.info](edav.info){target=\"_blank\"} Note that your headers (##, ###, etc.) will be converted to numbered headings as such: ## –&gt; 3.1 ### –&gt; 3.1.1 These headings will appear as chapter subheadings and sub-subheadings in the navigation panel on the left. Think about a logical structure for users to navigate your chapter. We recommend using only ## and ### headings since “sub-sub-subheadings” such as 4.1.3.4 are generally unnecessary and look messy. Unfortunately, there’s no simple way to preview your chapter before it’s actually merged into the project. (bookdown has preview_chapter() option but it only works after the entire book has been rendered at least once and that will become more and more complex and require more and more packages as the project grows.) If you really want to preview it, fork and clone this minimal bookdown repo, add your .Rmd file, click the “Build book” button on the Build tab (next to Git), and then open any of the .html files in the _book folder in a web browser to see the rendered book. If you’re interested in more bookdown options, see the official reference book. Have more useful tweaks to share? Submit an issue or PR. 2.5 FAQ 2.5.1 What should I expect after creating a pull request? Within a week after you create a pull request, we will apply a label to it and assign an administrator who will review all the files you submit to see if they meet the requirements. It will take some time before we can process all the pull requests, so as long as you see your pull request has been labeled and assigned to an admin, don’t worry. However, if the admin contacts you regarding the pull request, that usually means your files fail to meet some requirements. The admin will clearly state what is wrong, so please fix them as soon as possible. 2.5.2 What if I catch mistakes before my pull request is merged? Just make the changes on your branch, commit and push them to GitHub. They will automatically be added to the pull request. 2.5.3 What if I catch mistakes after my pull request is merged? You may submit additional pull requests to fix material on the site. If the edits are small, such as fixing typos, it is easiest to make the edits directly on GitHub, following these instructions. We will merge first pull requests before edits, so please be patient. 2.5.4 Other questions If you encounter other problems, please submit an issue and we will look into it.

It is acquired by Nasdaq in 2018 and has 20+ million data sets available. Users can acquire free data, purchase data or sell data at Quandl. You can find data on a large variety of types of data from company data to the demographics data of a country. More can be explored on Quandl’s website. https://www.quandl.com/search The data is readily available in json, csv, xml formats and can be loaded in MatLab, R, Python, etc. All the data can be loaded in R through the package Quandl. 4.1.1 Installation : install.packages(“Quandl”) 4.1.2 Load Package library(Quandl) library(Quandl) 4.1.3 Set API key Quandl allows 50 calls a day for anonymous users. Sign up for a free account to make unlimited calls every day. Set up your own account and copy your api_key into the following function Quandl.api_key(‘your_key’) Quandl.api_key(&#39;JrvHzZcnakybdzAUChjn&#39;) 4.1.4 Loading Data All available data can be found and viewed on https://www.quandl.com/search. This package includes many free datasets, however, some datasets requires an account or is for paid use only. To call on a data set in R. You must find the Quandl code of the data set. The codes can be found in the documentation page of the data set. 4.1.4.1 For example The follow dataset is called the “Federal Reserve Economic Data”, which has the code FRED. This dataset has 335,000+ time-series data. To call on certain aspect like the GDP of this data set, the Quandl code is “FRED/GDP”. mydata = Quandl(&quot;FRED/GDP&quot;) head(mydata) ## Date Value ## 1 2020-10-01 21487.90 ## 2 2020-07-01 21170.25 ## 3 2020-04-01 19520.11 ## 4 2020-01-01 21561.14 ## 5 2019-10-01 21747.39 ## 6 2019-07-01 21540.33 To call on another aspect like disposable personal income, the Quandl code is “FRED/DSPI” mydata= Quandl(&quot;FRED/DSPI&quot;) head(mydata) ## Date Value ## 1 2021-01-01 19217.7 ## 2 2020-12-01 17254.5 ## 3 2020-11-01 17151.4 ## 4 2020-10-01 17398.9 ## 5 2020-09-01 17546.8 ## 6 2020-08-01 17430.4 4.1.5 Type The data can be called in different formats.

By adding a transform argument in Quandl(), the data can have the following types of transformations. \"\" = Default original data “diff” = row on row change in value “rdiff” = row on row percentage change “normalize” = scale to start at 100 “cumul” = cumulative sum “rdiff_from” = latest value as % increment 4.1.6.1 For example the percentage change of GDP by year mydata = Quandl(&quot;FRED/GDP&quot;,transform = &quot;rdiff&quot; ) head(mydata) ## Date Value ## 1 2020-10-01 0.015004262 ## 2 2020-07-01 0.084535264 ## 3 2020-04-01 -0.094662207 ## 4 2020-01-01 -0.008564474 ## 5 2019-10-01 0.009613086 ## 6 2019-07-01 0.009866349 4.1.7 Order The data can be ordered by date upon it is loaded. Default is descending order by date. - “desc” - “asc” mydata = Quandl(&quot;FRED/GDP&quot;, order = &quot;asc&quot;) head(mydata) ## Date Value ## 1 1947-01-01 243.164 ## 2 1947-04-01 245.968 ## 3 1947-07-01 249.585 ## 4 1947-10-01 259.745 ## 5 1948-01-01 265.742 ## 6 1948-04-01 272.567 4.1.8 collapse Since all data have a time associated.

(Update: It does not need to be the same as the branch name.) The .Rmd filename can only contain lowercase letters. (Otherwise the filenames do not sort nicely on the repo home page.) 8.4 Check .Rmd file contents The file should not contain a YAML header nor a --- line. The second line should be blank, followed by the author name(s). The first line should start with a single hashtag #, followed by a single whitespace, and then the title. There should be no additional single hashtag headers in the chapter. (If there are, new chapters will be created.) Other hashtag headers should not be followed by numbers since the hashtags will create numbered subheadings. Correct: ## Subheading. Incorrect: ## 3. Subheading. If the file contains a setup chunk in .Rmd file, it should not contain a setup label. (The bookdown render will fail if there are duplicate chunk labels.) i.e. use {r, include=FALSE} instead of {r setup, include=FALSE}. See sample .Rmd Links to internal files must contain resources/&lt;project_name&gt;/ in the path, such as: ![Test Photo](resources/sample_project/election.jpg) The file should not contain any install.packages(), write functions, setwd(), or getwd(). If there’s anything else that looks odd but you’re not sure, assign jtr13 to review and explain the issue. 8.5 Request changes If there are problems with any of the checks listed above, explain why the pull request cannot be merged and request changes by following these steps: Then, add a changes requested label to this pull request. Your job for this pull request is done for now. Once contributors fix their requests, review again and either move forward with the merge or explain what changes still need to be made. 8.6 Merge the pull request If all is good to go, it’s time to merge the pull request. There are several steps. 8.6.1 Add chapter filename to _bookdown.yml in PR’s branch To access the PR branch: Make sure you are on the PR branch by checking that the PR branch name is shown (not main): Open the _bookdown.yml file. delete everything in the file beginning with rmd_files: [ and then add the name of the new file in single quotes followed by a comma: Why? Because it will be easier to fix the merge conflicts this way. (A better way to do this is to merge main into the PR branch before adding the new file but this can’t be done on GitHub. If there’s interest I will explain how to do this locally.) Save the edited version. Click the resolve conflicts button: Cut the new filename and paste it into the proper location. Then delete the lines with &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; xxxx, ======= and &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; main. In short, the file should look correct when you’re done. Click the “Marked as resolved” button and then the green “Commit merge” button. 8.6.2 PR Leaders only: Add part names to .Rmd for every first article in part Only do this if you are adding the first chapter in a PART. For every first article of each part, add the chapter name on the top of the .Rmd file, then propose changes. The example is like this. 8.6.3 Merge PR and leave a comment Now comes the final step. If you’re not sure that you did things correctly, assign one of the PR merge leaders or @jtr13 to review before you merge the PR. Go back to the conversation tab of the pull requests page, for example: https://github.com/jtr13/cc20/pull/23#issuecomment-728506101 Leave comments for congratulations 🎉 (type :tada:) and then click on the green button for merge. 8.6.4 Check updated version A successful merge means that the addition file or files were added to the project with no merge conflicts. It does not mean that the book will render and deploy to GitHub pages without issues. After the merge, it will take about 5-10 minutes for GitHub Actions to render the book and deploy the updated version. You can check the progress by clicking Actions at the top of the repo. If there’s a problem (a red circle) please request a review from @jtr13 in the closed pull request. "]]
