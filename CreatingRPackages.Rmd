# Creating R Packages

Sam Gabor

Creating custom R packages allows users to exchange code logic and data effortlessly. In addition, even if R packages are not shared with others, they still provide utility for the R user because they group related functionality into clean, easily maintained and tested units.

I created a tutorial that illustrates the creation of a non-trivial R package covering all the steps that constitute a good work flow. It culminates in publishing the created package on GitHub where it can be shared with other users using `devtools::install_github("atsats/PCD")`. 

The finished package as well as the Tutorial markdown, html and pdf files can be found here: https://github.com/atsats/PCD
