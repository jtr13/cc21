# Final project Zoom meetup - sports

Santos Hernandez

For my community contribution, I tried to connect people to project partners 
that had an interest in sports. After conducting a poll on Piazza to find the best 
time, I held a zoom session where people could find partners and brainstorm ideas 
for the final project. The session was on March 9th, 2021 from 9pm-10pm. 
Although only a few people showed, everyone was able to find project partners, 
including myself! I also made a followup post with some notes/resources that 
were gathered during the meeting. This document also had contact information in 
case someone missed the meeting and still needed a partner.
