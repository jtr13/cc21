# Work culture and time management

Sai Thrinath Gunda and Tarun Devireddy


Everyone is aware of the difference in the work culture, the management and type of work at Startups and MNCs, and across different organizations in consulting, technology and finance. Both Tarun and I have worked for 3years+ at multiple firms, including MNCs and Startups, and see a huge contrast in the kind of soft-skills required along with skills to manage timelines and understanding and meeting the expectations. 


We began the session with giving our backgrounds. We then discussed about the differences in Hierarchy, Goal setting, Expectations, Work Environment, Knowledge Transfer, Appraisals
at an MNC vs start up
